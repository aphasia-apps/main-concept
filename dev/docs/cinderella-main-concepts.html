<p>Essential information is <strong><em>italicized and bolded</em></strong>. Each essential
segment is numbered (superscript), with alternative productions (if any
were produced) listed by number below. These alternative productions are
not intended to be an exhaustive list, but represent some of the more
common productions of the normative sample and are included to aid in
scoring. Additional, but non-essential, information often spoken to
complete the main concept is in normal font.</p>

10.<sup>1</sup><em><strong>Cinderella</strong></em> is told by the stepmother she <sup>2</sup><em><strong>cannot go</strong></em> <sup>+</sup>to the ball<sup>+</sup> unless/because (insert reason).
</p>
<ol>
<li>
She
</li>
<li>
Could not go, has to stay home, is not allowed to go
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
Note: <sup>+</sup>See number 8.
</li>
<li>
Note: An alternative is “If Cinderella could get all of her chores done, she could go to the ball”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
11.<sup>1</sup><em><strong>The stepsisters</strong></em> <sup>2</sup><em><strong>tore</strong></em> <sup>3</sup><em><strong>Cinderella’s dress</strong></em>.

</ol>
<p>
12.<sup>1</sup><em><strong>Stepmother/stepsisters</strong></em> <sup>2</sup><em><strong>went</strong></em> <sup>+</sup>to the ball<sup>+</sup>.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Everyone but Cinderella
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
If “They went to the ball” is the sentence, the “they” must clearly exclude Cinderella in the context
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
Go, left, departed
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
Note: <sup>+</sup>See number 8.

<p>
14.<sup>1</sup><em><strong>A fairy godmother</strong></em> <sup>2</sup><em><strong>appeared</strong></em> to Cinderella.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
No alternative for “fairy godmother” was produced
</li>
<li>
Shows up, appears, surprises, comes
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Some may say “Cinderella sees” or “meets” or “finds”, in which case Cinderella then becomes an essential element
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Note: Another popular way of expressing this is “Along came a fairy godmother” (which is basically “appeared a fairy godmother”)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
15.<sup>1</sup><em><strong>The fairy godmother</strong></em> <sup>2</sup><em><strong>makes</strong></em> <sup>3</sup>{<em><strong>item</strong></em>(<em><strong>s</strong></em>)} <em><strong>turn into</strong></em> {<em><strong>items</strong></em>}.

</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
Pumpkin and mice OR carriage/coach and horses
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
When producing this concept, only one pair needs to be mentioned, however, it must be correctly paired to receive full credit
a. Pumpkin &amp;#8594 carriage/coach (and horses)
b. Mice &amp;#8594 horses (and carriage)
c. If they initially mention both pumpkin and mice, they do not necessarily have to mention both after the transformation occurs in order to receive full credit, and only one needs to be accurate
d. Do not take points off for mentioning other transformations, such as dog &amp;#8594 coachman as these are not incorrect, they simply did not reach significance.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
16.<sup>1</sup><em><strong>The fairy godmother</strong></em> <sup>2</sup><em><strong>makes</strong></em> <sup>3</sup><em><strong>Cinderella</strong></em> <sup>4</sup><em><strong>into a beautiful princess</strong></em>.

Cinderella
</li>
<li>
Must be, needs to be, must return
</li>
<li>
Leave by midnight
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
Note: An alternative could be “The fairy godmother told her that if she wasn’t home by midnight, XXX would happen” or something similar.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
19.<sup>1</sup><em><strong>The prince and Cinderella</strong></em> <sup>2</sup><em><strong>danced</strong></em> around the room/all night/with no one else.

</li>
<li>
Stepfamily, new family, the women, they

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Note: <sup>+</sup>***After Cinderella has been introduced into the story “she” is an acceptable alternative as long as there is a clear pronoun referent.

<li>
To normal (can specify what it turns back into)
</li>
</ol>
<ul>

See 23.3

<ul>
<li>
Note: Though most did not specifically mention Cinderella in these concepts (31, 32), it was clear that at this point in the story, they were referring to Cinderella.
</li>
<li>
Note: An alternate way to say this is “Cinderella tried on the slipper.”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
32.<sup>1</sup><em><strong>The slipper</strong></em> <sup>2</sup><em><strong>fits</strong></em> Cinderella perfectly.

<ul>
<li>
<p>
The speaker must indicate an extended length of time in order to receive an accurate and complete score. For example, “ever after,” “forever,” “a long time,” “life”
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Note: Variations can include “They lived happily every after”, “They were together forever”, “They had a wonderful life”

Maid, slave, domestic

</ol>
<ul>
<li>
Note: If they say the sentence in another way that expresses servitude, for example “had to wait on”, they must include stepmother and/or stepsisters, because the verb requires an object. This would be the only time they are essential for this concept.

Dance, big party, celebration, gala
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
Note: Occasionally this concept was combined with number 8 in a statement like, “They got an invitation to the ball the king was hosting for his son.” This should receive full credit for concepts 7 and 8.

</ul>
<p>
8.<sup>1</sup><em><strong>They</strong></em> <sup>2</sup><em><strong>got</strong></em> <sup>3</sup><em><strong>an invitation</strong></em> <sup>+</sup>to the ball<sup>+</sup>.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
1.<sup>1</sup><em><strong>The little girl</strong></em> <sup>2</sup><em><strong>was riding</strong></em> <sup>3</sup><em><strong>her bicycle</strong></em>.
