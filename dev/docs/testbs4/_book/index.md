# Introduction

Main Concept Analysis (MCA) is a discourse assessment originally
developed by Nicholas and Brookshire (1995) that measures the
informativeness of a discourse sample on a given topic. Main concept
checklists for several widely used tasks (including picture description,
picture sequence, story retell, and procedural stimuli) have been
developed based on discourse samples of control speakers (Richardson &
Dalton, 2016; 2020). MCA is a hybrid discourse measure that provides
some information on micro-linguistic features of the discourse sample as
well as more macro-linguistic features about the overall adequacy of the
discourse sample to communicate an intended message.

MCA has shown good sensitivity in differentiating between controls and
individuals with communication disorders (e.g., Kong, Whiteside, &
Bargmann, 2016; Dalton & Richardson, 2019) and between individuals with
fluent and non-fluent aphasia (Kong et al., 2016). Importantly, studies
have shown that changes in informativeness are associated with treatment
performance (Albright & Purves, 2008; Avent & Austermann, 2003; Coelho,
McHugh, & Boyle, 2000; Cupit, Rochon, Leonard, & Laird, 2010; Stark,
2010) and are associated with listener's perceptions of communication
quality (Cupit et al., 2010; Ross & Wertz, 1999).

Each main concept consists of several *essential elements*,
corresponding to the subject, main verb, object (if appropriate), and
any subordinate clauses (Nicholas & Brookshire, 1995). The main concept
is assigned one of 5 codes depending on the accuracy (are the essential
elements accurate?) and completeness (are essential elements present?)
of the production.
