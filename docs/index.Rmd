# Introduction

Main Concept Analysis (MCA) is a discourse assessment originally
developed by Nicholas and Brookshire (1995) that measures the
informativeness of a discourse sample on a given topic. Main concept
checklists for several widely used tasks (including picture description,
picture sequence, story retell, and procedural stimuli) have been
developed based on discourse samples of control speakers (Richardson &
Dalton, 2016; 2020). MCA is a hybrid discourse measure that provides
some information on micro-linguistic features of the discourse sample as
well as more macro-linguistic features about the overall adequacy of the
discourse sample to communicate an intended message.

MCA has shown good sensitivity in differentiating between controls and
individuals with communication disorders (e.g., Kong, Whiteside, &
Bargmann, 2016; Dalton & Richardson, 2019) and between individuals with
fluent and non-fluent aphasia (Kong et al., 2016). Importantly, studies
have shown that changes in informativeness are associated with treatment
performance (Albright & Purves, 2008; Avent & Austermann, 2003; Coelho,
McHugh, & Boyle, 2000; Cupit, Rochon, Leonard, & Laird, 2010; Stark,
2010) and are associated with listener's perceptions of communication
quality (Cupit et al., 2010; Ross & Wertz, 1999).

Each main concept consists of several *essential elements*,
corresponding to the subject, main verb, object (if appropriate), and
any subordinate clauses (Nicholas & Brookshire, 1995). The main concept
is assigned one of 5 codes depending on the accuracy (are the essential
elements accurate?) and completeness (are essential elements present?)
of the production.

[Coding:]{.ul}

-   AC = accurate and complete = contains all elements of the main
    > concept on the checklist with no incorrect information 

-   AI = accurate and incomplete = contains no incorrect information,
    > but leaves out at least one essential element of the main concept
    > on the checklist 

-   IC = inaccurate and complete = contains at least one incorrect piece
    > of essential information (e.g., "knight" for "prince") but
    > includes all essential elements of the main concept on the
    > checklist 

-   II = inaccurate and incomplete = clearly corresponds with a main
    > concept on the checklist but includes at least one incorrect
    > essential element and fails to include at least one essential
    > element 

-   AB = absent = did not produce the main concept

*\*To our knowledge, norms for AphasiaBank stimuli are only available
for the Richardson & Dalton 2016 scoring system. If using the Kong, 2009
system, scores cannot be compared to the Richardson & Dalton 2016 norms.
See Kong et al., 2016 for main concepts, checklists, and norms for
additional stimuli.*

Nicholas and Brookshire also developed a series of coding rules to
assist in determining the accuracy and completeness of main concepts.
These coding rules are now supplemented with the published checklists,
which provide common alternatives produced for each main concept, since
there is variability in the syntax and vocabulary that could be used to
produce a main concept. These alternative lists are not comprehensive,
so it is possible that a client may produce an acceptable alternative
that is not in the checklist.

Note to Remember:

-   Main concepts do not have to be given in the transcript in the same order they are shown in the main concept list.

    -   [Cinderella Example]{.ul}

        -   Concept: 18. She knew **she had to be home by midnight**
            > because everything will turn back at midnight.

            -   What if this occurs later in the story (e.g., after #21
                > -- something like "she heard the clock and knew she
                > had to be home by midnight")

                -   *Yes, we would still allow that to count. There
                    > seemed to be a couple of "typical" orderings of
                    > MCs. We went with the most frequent when ordering
                    > our list.*

                -   *More/updated information on sequencing for
                    > Cinderella is available via Greenslade et al.,
                    > 2020 -
                    > <https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_AJSLP-19-00151>*

-   If a main concept is spoken several times, score the final version.

-   Essential elements can be produced across multiple utterances.

"Now I'm going to show you these pictures.\" (Present picture series.)

"Take a little time to look at these pictures. They tell a story. Take a
look at all of them, and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a
beginning, a middle, and an end. You can look at the pictures as you
tell the story."

If no response in 10 seconds, give second prompt: "Take a look at this
picture (point to first picture) and tell me what you think is
happening."

If needed, point to each picture sequentially, giving the prompt: "And
what happens here?"

For each panel, if no response, provide the prompt: "Can you tell me
anything about this picture?"

If no response, point to the picture and ask: "Is the boy kicking the
ball through the window?"

# Broken Window Main Concept Checklist

Essential information is *italicized* and **bolded**. Each essential
segment is numbered (superscript) with alternative productions (if any
were produced) listed by number below. These alternative productions ARE
NOT intended to be an exhaustive list but represent some of the more
common productions of the normative sample and are included to aid in
scoring. Additional, but non-essential, information often spoken to
complete the main concept is in normal font. If multiple utterances can
correspond with an MC, select the best utterance presented for the
purposes of coding/scoring.

<!-- 1)  ***^1^A/The boy ^2^was ^3^outside*.** -->

<!--     a.  *He, any name (e.g., Johnny, Mark)* -->

<!--     b.  *Is, decided to go* -->

<!--     c.  *In his yard, on the lawn, out of the house, etc.* -->

<!-- > Note: Sometimes combined with MC2 in a statement such as "The boy was -->
<!-- > playing soccer outside" or "The boy was kicking the ball in the yard". -->
<!-- > These statements would receive AC codes for MC1 and MC2. -->

Present picture book (or ppt/pdf).

"I'm going to ask you to tell a story. Have you ever heard the story of
Cinderella?

(Make note of answer for demographic data. If answer is no, ask
participant to tell a fairy tale s/he knows.)

Do you remember much about it? These pictures might remind you of how it
goes. Take a look at the pictures and then I'll put the book away, and
ask you to tell me the story in your own words."

Allow participant to look through book (assist with page turning if
needed) and then, if necessary, prompt: "Now tell me as much of the
story of Cinderella as you can. You can use any details you know about
the story, as well as the pictures you just looked at."

If participant gives a response of fewer than three utterances, or seems
to falter, allow 10 seconds, then prompt: "What happened next?" or "Go
on."

Continue until participant concludes story or it is clear s/he has
finished.

If no response, go to Troubleshooting questions.

response.)

"Let's move on to something a little different. Tell me how you would
make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich."

If no response in 10 seconds, give second prompt: "If you were feeling
hungry for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, how would you make it?"

Note: For concepts 1-5, "put" is not an acceptable verb. For each of
those concepts there was a similar relevant concept (i.e., "put the
bread on the counter"), however, none of these relevant concepts reached
criterion. In these cases, the speaker would receive a score of absent,
and any information associated with the verb "put" should be treated as
extra information that is not scored. (But see N&B rules for
Completeness/***Statements containing some of the essential
information***)

# Refused Umbrella Main Concepts

Essential information is ***italicized and bolded***. Each essential
segment is numbered (superscript) with alternative productions (if any
were produced) listed by number below. These alternative productions are
not intended to be an exhaustive list but represent some of the more
common productions of the normative sample and are included to aid in
scoring. Additional, but non-essential, information often spoken to
complete the main concept is in normal font.

Healthy control speakers often used reported speech (e.g., one of the
characters speaking to the other) in order to tell this story. Main
Concepts that are produced as reported speech should be scored for the
corresponding concept, even if the reported speech causes the concept to
be stated in a different format than that reported below. Additionally,
during interactions between the mother and boy, main concepts were often
expressed from either character's perspective.

# Nicholas & Brookshire Coding Rules with Examples from Richardson & Dalton

## **[Accuracy]{.ul}**

### ***Wording***

-   The wording of essential information does not have to be the same as
    > that of the listed main concept, but the general meaning must be
    > the same. 

    -   Some alternate versions of essential information in specific
        > main concepts are given in parentheses in the main concept
        > lists. There may be appropriate alternatives not listed. 

    -   Figures of speech and colloquialisms are acceptable.

-   [Cookie Theft Example -]{.ul} For the main concept, \"The woman is
    > doing the dishes,\" the following statements would be considered
    > accurate because they are plausible given the stimulus picture:

    -   The mother is cleaning the dishes.

    -   The maid is drying a plate.

    -   The lady was washing her dishes.

-   [Broken Window Example --]{.ul} For main concept 4 "***^1^The man
    > ^2^is sitting*** in a chair and/or inside the house", the
    > following statements would be considered accurate.

    -   The father is relaxing in his recliner.

    -   The neighbor is sitting in the living room.

    -   The man is resting and watching TV.

    -   The man is sitting.

    -   He is just sitting there. (as long as "he" is not ambiguous,
        > e.g., pointing to third frame, or following a sentence like
        > "That must be the neighbor. He is just sitting there.", etc.)

-   [Cinderella Examples]{.ul}

    -   Concept 1: **Dad remarried a woman** with two daughters.

        -   Is married OK, or does it have to say 'remarried'?

            -   *Married is ok. There does not have to be some
                > indication of repetition -- the first choice in the
                > appendix is "got married to" which does not require
                > some indication of repetition*

    -   Concept 3: ***^1^Stepmother/ stepsisters ^2^were mean ^3^to
        > Cinderella.***

        -   Does "they treated her like dirt" count?

            -   *If "her" clearly references Cinderella based on
                > transcript, and "they" clearly reference the
                > stepmother and/or stepsisters, "like dirt" matches the
                > alternative productions in terms of semantic meaning,
                > so this would be accurate (and complete)*

        -   Does "her mother was kind of mean to her" count?

            -   *If they do not mention the word "step", there must
                > be/have been some indication that the stepmother is a
                > unit separate from Cinderella; mother here implies
                > "real" or "biological" mother, which would be
                > inaccurate*

            -   *It could also be argued that "kind of mean" is not the
                > same as the options indicated in the checklist -
                > "mean, cruel, wicked, treated Cinderella poorly, were
                > awful, hated" - but this may be too subjective*

    -   Concept 5: Cinderella **has to do** all the housework

        -   "Had some chores that she should do"

            -   *Because verb \"should\" is a suggestion, and not a verb
                > portraying that does not leave a choice/force/control,
                > it changes the meaning. THIS IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND
                > A RULE WITH FREQUENT DISAGREEMENT*

    -   Concept 8. **They got an invitation** to the ball.

        -   "there was an announcement about a ball" (assuming not OK,
            > as there was no alternative for 'invitation')

            -   *You are correct, invitation was the only word used for
                > this concept. "announcement about a ball" could be
                > applied to MC7 though (King announces **there is going
                > to be a ball** in honor of son who needs to find a
                > wife.)*

    -   Concept 11: **The stepsisters tore Cinderella's dress.**

        -   Does it have to be the dress or can "tore jewelry" count?

            -   *We have accepted jewelry in the past though no other
                > alternatives are listed in the appendix, it is
                > something that is torn and is visible in the picture
                > book as well, and we didn't explicitly say "no
                > alternatives were produced", as we did for
                > invitation.*

    -   Concept 21: Cinderella realized **it is midnight.**

        -   Does "at midnight she had to run away" count?

            -   *Yes, this would count*

    -   Concept 22: **She ran down the stairs.**

        -   "she ran off" -- does this count? Or does it have to be "ran
            > away" or "ran out"?

            -   *"off" would count*

### ***Grammatical form and word order***

-   Essential information does not have to be spoken in standard
    > grammatical form or standard word order, as long as deviations
    > would not lead to miscomprehension of the essential meaning of the
    > main concept. 

-   [Cookie Theft Example -]{.ul} For the main concept, \"The woman is
    > doing the dishes,\" the following statements would be considered
    > accurate:

    -   Mother do dishes.

    -   Lady drying some plate.

    -   Woman dishes drying them.

-   [Broken Window Example --]{.ul} For main concept 6 "***^1^The ball
    > ^2^breaks ^3^a lamp.***" the following statements would be
    > considered accurate.

    -   Ball break lamp(s).

    -   Ball lamp broken.

    -   Lamp is broken um ball boom.

### ***Articulation***

-   Essential words do not have to be correctly articulated to be
    > considered accurate, as long as they would be intelligible to a
    > listener as the target words in the context of what the speaker is
    > saying. 

    -   Assume that the listener has seen the stimulus picture.

-   [Broken Window Example]{.ul}

    -   Concept 6: "***^1^The ball ^2^breaks ^3^a lamp.***"

        -   "knocked over a **lap** in the man's house after going
            > through the window"

    -   Concept 3: ***^1^The ball ^2^breaks ^3^the*** man's/neighbor's
        > ***window.***

        -   "And window ch **bwoke** by ball"

    -   Concept 2: ***^1^A/The boy ^2^was playing ^3^soccer.***

        -   "Dah boy **bahlayed** soccer"

### ***Inaccurate*** ***\[nonessential\]*** ***words in accurate main concepts***

-   If the essential information in a main concept is accurate, but
    > inaccurate words also are included in the concept, consider the
    > main concept accurate unless the inaccurate words alter essential
    > information to make it inaccurate. 

-   [Cookie Theft Example -]{.ul} For the main concept "The woman/mother
    > is doing dishes", the following statement would be considered
    > accurate:

    -   \"The woman is drying the dishes with a bath towel\"

        -   Even though the woman is using a dish towel, the essential
            > information is accurate, because "towel" or "cloth" is not
            > an essential element.

-   [Broken Window Example -]{.ul} For main concept 4 "***^1^The man
    > ^2^is sitting*** in a chair and/or inside the house", the
    > following statement would be considered accurate:

    -   \"The man is sitting reading a newspaper\"

        -   Even though the man is not reading anything, the essential
            > information is accurate, and "reading a newspaper" is not
            > essential.

    -   "The man sit sofa"

        -   Even though he is sitting in a chair, not on a sofa, the
            > essential information is accurate, and "chair" is not
            > essential

        -   (See also above rule for Accuracy/Grammatical form and word
            > order for "The man sit" portion of this production)

-   [Cinderella Examples]{.ul} - For main concept 19: "***^1^The prince
    > and Cinderella ^2^danced*** around the room/all night/with no one
    > else", the following statement would be considered inaccurate:

    -   \"Um... man i-is dancing da teacher and Cinderella um dances
        > on\"

        -   teacher replaces man, which makes it incorrect because it\'s
            > not the prince, but Cinderella and the verb dancing are
            > present, completing all the elements.

### ***Effects of statement form on essential information***

-   The form in which a speaker chooses to state a main concept affects
    > which information is considered essential. 

-   [Cookie Theft Example -]{.ul} Not provided by Nicholas & Brookshire
    > (1995). (The example they give in their appendix is for the
    > procedure of how to do dishes.)

-   [Broken Window Example -]{.ul} We haven't actually seen an example
    > of this.

-   [Refused Umbrella Example]{.ul} - for main concept 2 "The mother
    > says ***^1^you ^2^need to take ^3^the umbrella***", the following
    > would be considered accurate (see checklist, Note 1):

    -   "***^2^***Take this ***^3^***umbrella", since English allows the
        > subject to be dropped in a command.

### ***Inaccurate pronoun referents***

-   If a referent is inaccurate but a pronoun that refers to it is
    > accurate, consider the statement with the pronoun accurate. 

-   [Cookie Theft Example -]{.ul} For the main concept "The woman is
    > doing dishes" if the following statements were made:

    -   \"The man is washing dishes. She is not paying attention to her
        > kids\"

        -   The first statement would be considered inaccurate but the
            > second would be considered accurate.

-   [Broken Window Example -]{.ul} For main concept 7 "***^1^The man
    > ^2^picks up ^3^the ball***" if the following statements were made:

    -   \"The woman picks up the ball. He looks out the window.\"

        -   The first statement would be considered inaccurate but the
            > second statement would be considered accurate because the
            > pronoun correctly refers to a male.

### ***Restatement of essential information***

-   If essential information is stated one way and then restated, score
    > the final version spoken. 

-   [Cookie Theft Example -]{.ul} for the main concept "The woman is
    > doing the dishes" if the following statements were made:

    -   \"The woman, he is doing the dishes.\" This statement would be
        > considered inaccurate.

    -   \"The man no woman is doing the dishes,\" the statement would be
        > considered accurate.

-   [Broken Window Example]{.ul} - for main concept 2 "***^1^A/The boy
    > ^2^was playing ^3^soccer.***" if the following statements were
    > made:

    -   "The boy is playing baseball, no, soccer," the statement would
        > be considered accurate.

    -   "The boy was kicking a soccer ball. And the ball goes way up
        > high. So the boy was playing baseball."

        -   You would score "The boy was playing baseball" for main
            > concept 2, because this is a restatement of the first
            > utterance, even though it results in a lower score.

-   [Refused Umbrella Example]{.ul} - individuals with more cognitive
    > involvement may not realize/express their understanding at first
    > that the mother has offered the umbrella (main concept 2) and that
    > the boy has refused it (main concept 3), but may correct
    > themselves when they get to the bottom panel (pictures 4-6). They
    > may then go back and revise their statements and these revisions
    > (the final versions) would be what is scored.

    -   (This may mean that they end up scoring quite well for main
        > concepts, but you should make a notation somewhere that this
        > individual "missed" the gist, which was NOT commonly observed
        > in controls OR PWAs, and may warrant further assessment of
        > cognitive abilities/inference.)

## **[Completeness]{.ul}**

### ***Missing essential information***

-   If only some of the essential information (***bold italicized***)
    > for a main concept is mentioned, either in its list form or in a
    > form that has the same general meaning, consider the main concept
    > incomplete.

-   [Broken Window Example]{.ul} - For main concept 2: **"*^1^A/The boy
    > ^2^was playing ^3^soccer*"** the following statements would be
    > incomplete:

    -   "The boy is playing."

    -   "The boy soccer ball."

-   [Cinderella Example]{.ul} - For main concept 22: **"*^1^She ^2^ran
    > ^3^down the stairs*"** the following statement would be
    > incomplete:

    -   "And she had to run."

        -   "she" is correct, if there is a clear pronoun referent or if
            > it is not ambiguous; "run" is present; what is missing is
            > "down the stairs" (or some acceptable alternative, e.g.,
            > out of the ball, away from the castle/prince/ball, out,
            > away, etc.)

### ***Statements containing some of the essential information***

-   If a statement that is not listed as a main concept contains some of
    > the essential information for a main concept, consider the main
    > concept incomplete. 

-   [Cookie Theft Example -]{.ul} For the main concept "The woman is
    > doing the dishes" the following utterance would be considered
    > incomplete:

    -   \"**The woman** is standing there\". This would be the case as
        > long as \"woman\" was not counted toward another main concept
        > and the character has not been mentioned previously. Such
        > statements serve to establish a character, element, or action
        > in a story.

-   [Broken Window Examples]{.ul}

    -   For main concept 4: **"*^1^The man ^2^is sitting*** in a chair
        > and/or inside the house." the following statement would be
        > incomplete:

        -   "The ball hit a man."

    -   For main concept 2: **"*^1^A/The boy ^2^was playing
        > ^3^soccer*"** the following statement would be incomplete:

        -   "It is a ball."

-   [Cinderella Examples]{.ul}

    -   For main concept 1 "***^1^Dad ^2^remarried ^3^a woman*** with
        > two daughters.", the following statement would be considered
        > incomplete/credited towards this main concept:

        -   "She lost her dad", "Her dad died", because this was the
            > introduction/establishment of a major character of the
            > story, and no other statements mapped on to this concept.

    -   For main concept 8 "King announces ***^1^there is going to be
        > ^2^a ball*** in honor of son who needs to find a wife." or
        > main concept 17 "***^1^Cinderella ^2^went ^3^to the ball*** in
        > the coach", the following statement could be credited towards
        > one of those concepts, depending on where/when in the episodic
        > structure the person produces the utterance:

        -   "Then .... ball", because this introduces/establishes a
            > major element of this story

### ***Nonspecific words***

-   If nonspecific words are spoken in place of essential information,
    > consider the main concept incomplete. 

-   [Cookie Theft Example -]{.ul} For the main concept "The woman is
    > washing the dishes", the following statement would be incomplete:

    -   \"The woman is washing that thing.\"

        -   \*BUT\* In some cases there may be legitimate uncertainty
            > about a specific person or element in a picture (e.g.,
            > \"Someone is fishing\" \[WAB Picnic Scene\]). In such
            > instances, the nonspecific word will appear on the main
            > concept list and its use will not render the main concept
            > incomplete.

-   [Broken Window Example -]{.ul} For main concept 4: **"*^1^The man
    > ^2^is sitting*** in a chair and/or inside the house", the
    > following statement would be incomplete:

    -   "Someone is in the house."

-   [Cat Rescue/Cat in the Tree Example]{.ul} - For main concept 8:
    > "***^1^Someone ^2^called ^3^the fire department***."

    -   This action is not pictured in the stimulus, so there is
        > legitimate uncertainty about who calls. A reference to any
        > person would be appropriate here, or the use of a nonspecific
        > "somebody" or "someone". (Examples are provided in the
        > published checklist)

### ***Pronoun referents***

-   If the referent for a pronoun is ambiguous, consider the main
    > concept that contains the ambiguous pronoun incomplete, *[but only
    > for the first use of the pronoun for that referent ]{.ul}*

-   Do not consider a main concept incomplete if there is no antecedent
    > referent for a pronoun but the referent is clear from
    > context/unambiguous. 

    -   For example, if there is only one \"she\" or \"he\" or \"they\"
        > in a picture, or only one figure is completing a specific
        > action, the pronoun would be unambiguous without an antecedent
        > referent. 

-   [Cookie Theft Example --]{.ul} For the main concept "The boy is
    > falling off the stool" the following utterance is complete:

    -   "He is about to fall." This is unambiguous without a referent
        > because the only male figure in the picture is the little boy
        > standing on the stool.

-   [Broken Window Example -]{.ul} For main concept 4 "***^1^The man
    > ^2^is sitting*** in a chair and/or inside the house" the following
    > utterance is complete:

    -   "He is sitting inside." This is unambiguous because there is
        > only one person pictured inside the house.

-   [Cinderella Examples]{.ul}

    -   Concept 2: **Cinderella lives with stepmother/stepsisters.**

        -   Does "they combined families" count?

            -   *If "they" is referring to some set of individuals that
                > clearly includes Cinderella, then this could be
                > interpreted similarly to "Cinderella/she has new
                > family", which would be allowed and would AC.*

            -   *However, if "they" is unclear or if "they" is referring
                > only to the father and the stepmother, this does not
                > apply to this concept, it is a separate concept, and
                > this would receive the code of AB.*

        -   Does "When they brought Cinderella home..." count?

            -   *AC as long as appropriate pronoun referent; This seems
                > to be most similar to a restructuring of acceptable
                > alternatives of she/Cinderella (1), moves in with (2),
                > new family/they (3).*

    -   Pronouns/antecedents: How stringent are the criteria for
        > ensuring that the pronouns are unambiguous? If there is
        > syntactic ambiguity regarding who went to the ball (e.g., in
        > some cases "she went to the ball" could syntactically be
        > either Cinderella or the Godmother), is that counted as
        > incorrect even though it may be assumed shared knowledge that
        > Cinderella went to the ball?

        -   *We allowed shared knowledge in those instances, so we would
            > score that as AC, as long as both Cinderella and the Fairy
            > Godmother had been mentioned (guided by Nicholas and
            > Brookshire rules)*

## Additional Notes on Nicholas and Brookshire Rules

-   Main concepts do not have to be spoken in the same order they are
    > shown in the main concept list.

    -   [Broken Window Example]{.ul}

        -   "There is a little boy playing soccer, he's outside in the
            > yard"

            -   MC2 is produced first and should be coded as AC. MC1 is
                > produced second and should also be coded as AC.

-   If a main concept is spoken several times, ALWAYS score the final
    > version.

    -   [Broken Window Example]{.ul}

        -   "*The boy is playing soccer, practicing for the team
            > try-outs, so he's kicking the ball, and it goes right
            > through the window*"

            -   Both "*the boy is playing soccer*" and "*he's kicking
                > the ball*" apply to MC2. Since, "*he's kicking the
                > ball*" is produced later, that is the utterance that
                > should be scored for MC2.

            -   This is true even if the later utterance results in an
                > error code, while the first utterance would receive an
                > AC code.

-   Essential elements for main concepts can be produced across multiple
    > utterances.

    -   There are many different criteria used to segment discourse into
        > utterances. Practicing clinicians may not have the time or
        > training on specific segmenting approaches. If essential
        > elements are produced within a reasonable distance within a
        > string of words, regardless of where utterance boundaries may
        > be placed, they can still count towards a single main concept.

    -   [Broken Window Example -]{.ul} for main concept 8: "***^1^The
        > man ^2^looked ^3^out of the window.***" the following
        > utterances can be scored together:

        -   Utterance 1: "*man gets up."*

        -   Utterance 2: "*mad mad mad."*

        -   Utterance 3: "*looks out the window.*

-   The verb tense used in the production should **not** impact the code
    > received. Any inflected form of the verbs listed in the checklist
    > should be allowed.

    -   [Broken Window Example -]{.ul} for main concept 8: "***^1^The
        > man ^2^looked ^3^out of the window.***" the following
        > utterances would be accurate and complete:

        -   "the man is looking outside"

        -   "so the man will go look out the glass to see who's there"

        -   "the man looks out the window"

-   One utterance can be used to produce two or more main concepts

    -   [Broken Window Example -]{.ul} for main concept 7 "***^1^The man
        > ^2^picks up ^3^the ball.***" and 8 "***^1^The man ^2^looked
        > ^3^out of the window.***" the following statement would be
        > accurate and complete:

        -   "the man picks up the ball and looks out."

        -   "the man looks out the window holding the ball."

OTHER EXAMPLES, TO BE FILED UNDER CORRECT ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS RULE

-   [Cinderella Examples]{.ul}

    -   Concept 1: **Dad remarried a woman** with two daughters.

        -   OK if this spans 2 utterances? (e.g., The dad remarried. The
            > woman was mean...)

            -   *We would score "the dad remarried" as AI -- The object
                > of the sentence is missing. "The woman was mean" was
                > actually a separate concept that is seen represented
                > in the 3^rd^ concept in the appendix.*

            -   *We have had disagreement over this, as we have stated
                > that MCs can span utterances, and since there is a
                > clear inference/relationship in this example.*

    -   Concept 18: She knew **she had to be home by midnight** because
        > everything will turn back at midnight.

        -   *Does "Had to be back by midnight" count?*

            -   *would code as AC, assuming there was a subject; if no
                > subject, then AI*

    -   Concept 10: **Cinderella** is told by the stepmother she
        > **cannot go** to the ball unless/because (insert reason)

        -   Would "And Cinderella um go no" count as complete for this?

            -   *Scored as AI, however, it matters if the patient
                > intends "no" as a revision*

    -   *There are examples in Richardson & Dalton (2016) of how to code
        > utterances where verbs are omitted (i.e., "Mother dishes" is
        > AI), but none where a subject is omitted. Is it necessary for
        > an utterance to have a subject to be an MC? Or could an
        > utterance be coded as AI/II if it is missing the subject but
        > contains other essential components?*

        -   *A STATEMENT DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE A SUBJECT TO BE CODED AS
            > AN MC, IT CAN BE GIVEN AN AI/II CODE AS APPROPRIATE.*

    -   *How does more complex syntax influence the interpretation of
        > MCs? Specifically, what do you do if the participant uses a
        > compound predicate; can this count as 2 MCs with the common
        > subject (e.g., "Cinderella lives with her stepmother and
        > stepsisters and had to do all the housework for them.")*

        -   *WE WOULD GIVE CREDIT FOR BOTH MCs. BOTH WOULD RECEIVE AN
            > \"AC\".*

    -   *What if the MC subject is an object of a sentence with a verb
        > clause following it that includes the MC verb/object (e.g.,
        > "there was a girl named Cinderella who lived with her
        > stepmother and stepsisters.")*

        -   *IN THE SECOND INSTANCE, WE WOULD GIVE CREDIT FOR MC2 FOR
            > THE VERB CLAUSE. \"WHO\" CLEARLY REFERENCES CINDERELLA IN
            > THE MAIN CLAUSE, SO THE PARTICIPANT SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED
            > THE SUBJECT (WHO = CINDERELLA), VERB (LIVED), AND
            > ADDITIONAL INFO (WITH STEPMOM/STEPSISTERS). WE WOULD CODE
            > THIS AS AN \"AC\" FOR MC2.*

    -   *How much of an utterance is needed to count as a main concept?
        > "At the strike of midnight" has no subject and no verb, but
        > includes "strike" (as a noun) and "midnight" -- two of the
        > essential elements from MC 21. Does this still count as MC
        > 21?*

        -   *WE WOULD COUNT THIS AS MC 21. THIS GOES BACK TO THE
            > NICHOLAS & BROOKSHIRE RULE THAT SAYS THAT THE FORMULATION
            > OF THE MC CAN IMPACT WHAT IS CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL. SINCE
            > THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE FORMULATION IN ENGLISH TO EXPRESS
            > THE CONCEPT OF IT BEING MIDNIGHT, IT WOULD BE SCORED AS
            > \"AC\".*

    -   *How do you count subordinate clauses that do have a separate
        > verb from the main clause? Can the subordinate clause stand on
        > its own as an MC? (e.g., "Cinderella lives with her stepmother
        > and stepsisters who are very mean to her")*

        -   *YES, WE WOULD ALLOW THIS STATEMENT TO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR
            > BOTH MC2 AND MC3.*

    -   *How do you handle situations in which an utterance clearly
        > relates to an MC, but is formulated with different words? Do
        > you handle it differently if the utterance requires an
        > inference to understand how it is related? (e.g., "her dad
        > introduces Cinderella to his new wife" -- implies he got
        > re-married \[MC1\]; "the king is upset that his son hasn't
        > married" -- implies the king thinks his son should get married
        > \[MC6\]; "one of the caveats of the fairy's spell is that it
        > ended at midnight" -- implies \[MC18\])*

        -   *THESE EXAMPLES SHOULD NOT COUNT TOWARDS THE MCs YOU
            > IDENTIFIED, AS IT REQUIRES TOO MUCH INFERENCE AND DOES NOT
            > DIRECTLY EXPRESS THE GIST; ALSO, IN OUR NORMING SAMPLE,
            > EACH OF THOSE STATEMENTS WERE RELEVANT CONCEPTS THAT DID
            > NOT REACH THE CUT-OFF TO BE CONSIDERED MCs.*

        -   *BUT SEE RULE FOR COMPLETENESS/**Statements containing some
            > of the essential information***

TO BE ANSWERED

-   Concept 3: Stepmother and/or stepsisters were mean to Cinderella

    -   "They didn't really give her enough attention"

    -   What is the strength of \"giving enough attention\" and how does
        > it relate to main concept of \"being mean\" ?

-   Concept 4: Cinderella was a servant to the stepmother and
    > stepsisters.

    -   "She was white trash"

    -   Is white trash similar enough to being lesser than, but not
        > similar enough to servitude? OR is it just a statement that is
        > being made by the participant and it doesn\'t really
        > add/contribute to the main concept?
