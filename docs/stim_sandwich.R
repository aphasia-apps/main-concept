"1.<sup>1</sup>***Get*** <sup>2</sup>***bread*** <sup>3</sup>***out*** of the pantry/cupboard/refrigerator/freezer/etc.
1. Take out, remove, grab, find, pull out
2. Loaf, bread loaf, bread bag
3. From (which if used, must be followed by a location from the speaker)

s2<-
"2.<sup>1</sup>***Get*** <sup>2</sup>***two slices*** <sup>3</sup>***of bread***.
1. See 1.1
2. A couple of slices, two pieces
 - Most speakers indicated more than one piece of bread. However, if the speaker uses one piece of bread throughout the story, and for #8 uses “fold” or “close”, or indicates in some way that they made a half sandwich, then one slice/piece of bread is allowed. Speakers must be consistent throughout the telling for this to be counted as correct.
3. If the speaker received full credit for the first concept, they do not necessarily have to repeat “of bread” to be counted correct/complete for this concept. For example, a speaker could say “You take the bread out of the pantry and get two slices.”

"3.<sup>1</sup>***Get*** <sup>2</sup>***the peanut butter***.
1. See 1.1

- Note: A concept like “take off the lid on the peanut butter” or “open the peanut butter” cannot be used for this concept. This was a relevant concept that did not reach significance.

1. Place, smash, slap, smack, stick
2. The bread, the two slices of bread, the two sides, the peanut butter and jelly, the two, the two halves, them
3. If the speaker does not say “together” they must give some indication that the two pieces become one (i.e., “Put one piece on top of the other”, “Combine the pieces of bread”, “Put the second piece of bread on top.”)
 - The verbs “fold” and “close” cannot be used for this concept, unless the speaker tells the entire story with one piece of bread as if making half of a sandwich, see 2.2.i.
