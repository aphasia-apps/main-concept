<div id="accuracy" class="section level2" number="14.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.1</span> <strong><u>Accuracy</u></strong></h2>
<div id="wording" class="section level3" number="14.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.1.1</span> <strong><em>Wording</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The wording of essential information does not have to be the same as
&gt; that of the listed main concept, but the general meaning must be
&gt; the same. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some alternate versions of essential information in specific
&gt; main concepts are given in parentheses in the main concept
&gt; lists. There may be appropriate alternatives not listed. </p></li>
<li><p>Figures of speech and colloquialisms are acceptable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Cookie Theft Example -</u> For the main concept, "The woman is
&gt; doing the dishes," the following statements would be considered
&gt; accurate because they are plausible given the stimulus picture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The mother is cleaning the dishes.</p></li>
<li><p>The maid is drying a plate.</p></li>
<li><p>The lady was washing her dishes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example –</u> For main concept 4 “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>The man
&gt; <sup>2</sup>is sitting</em></strong> in a chair and/or inside the house”, the
&gt; following statements would be considered accurate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The father is relaxing in his recliner.</p></li>
<li><p>The neighbor is sitting in the living room.</p></li>
<li><p>The man is resting and watching TV.</p></li>
<li><p>The man is sitting.</p></li>
<li><p>He is just sitting there. (as long as “he” is not ambiguous,
&gt; e.g., pointing to third frame, or following a sentence like
&gt; “That must be the neighbor. He is just sitting there.”, etc.)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Cinderella Examples</u></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Concept 1: <strong>Dad remarried a woman</strong> with two daughters.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is married OK, or does it have to say ‘remarried’?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Married is ok. There does not have to be some
&gt; indication of repetition – the first choice in the
&gt; appendix is “got married to” which does not require
&gt; some indication of repetition</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Concept 3: <strong><em><sup>1</sup>Stepmother/ stepsisters <sup>2</sup>were mean <sup>3</sup>to
&gt; Cinderella.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does “they treated her like dirt” count?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If “her” clearly references Cinderella based on
&gt; transcript, and “they” clearly reference the
&gt; stepmother and/or stepsisters, “like dirt” matches the
&gt; alternative productions in terms of semantic meaning,
&gt; so this would be accurate (and complete)</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Does “her mother was kind of mean to her” count?</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>If they do not mention the word “step”, there must
&gt; be/have been some indication that the stepmother is a
&gt; unit separate from Cinderella; mother here implies
&gt; “real” or “biological” mother, which would be
&gt; inaccurate</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>It could also be argued that “kind of mean” is not the
&gt; same as the options indicated in the checklist -
&gt; “mean, cruel, wicked, treated Cinderella poorly, were
&gt; awful, hated” - but this may be too subjective</em></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Concept 5: Cinderella <strong>has to do</strong> all the housework</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Had some chores that she should do”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Because verb "should" is a suggestion, and not a verb
&gt; portraying that does not leave a choice/force/control,
&gt; it changes the meaning. THIS IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND
&gt; A RULE WITH FREQUENT DISAGREEMENT</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Concept 8. <strong>They got an invitation</strong> to the ball.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“there was an announcement about a ball” (assuming not OK,
&gt; as there was no alternative for ‘invitation’)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You are correct, invitation was the only word used for
&gt; this concept. “announcement about a ball” could be
&gt; applied to MC7 though (King announces <strong>there is going
&gt; to be a ball</strong> in honor of son who needs to find a
&gt; wife.)</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Concept 11: <strong>The stepsisters tore Cinderella’s dress.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does it have to be the dress or can “tore jewelry” count?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We have accepted jewelry in the past though no other
&gt; alternatives are listed in the appendix, it is
&gt; something that is torn and is visible in the picture
&gt; book as well, and we didn’t explicitly say “no
&gt; alternatives were produced”, as we did for
&gt; invitation.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Concept 21: Cinderella realized <strong>it is midnight.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does “at midnight she had to run away” count?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yes, this would count</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Concept 22: <strong>She ran down the stairs.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>“she ran off” – does this count? Or does it have to be “ran
&gt; away” or “ran out”?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“off” would count</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="grammatical-form-and-word-order" class="section level3" number="14.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.1.2</span> <strong><em>Grammatical form and word order</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Essential information does not have to be spoken in standard
&gt; grammatical form or standard word order, as long as deviations
&gt; would not lead to miscomprehension of the essential meaning of the
&gt; main concept. </p></li>
<li><p><u>Cookie Theft Example -</u> For the main concept, "The woman is
&gt; doing the dishes," the following statements would be considered
&gt; accurate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mother do dishes.</p></li>
<li><p>Lady drying some plate.</p></li>
<li><p>Woman dishes drying them.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example –</u> For main concept 6 “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>The ball
&gt; <sup>2</sup>breaks <sup>3</sup>a lamp.</em></strong>” the following statements would be
&gt; considered accurate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ball break lamp(s).</p></li>
<li><p>Ball lamp broken.</p></li>
<li><p>Lamp is broken um ball boom.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="articulation" class="section level3" number="14.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.1.3</span> <strong><em>Articulation</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Essential words do not have to be correctly articulated to be
&gt; considered accurate, as long as they would be intelligible to a
&gt; listener as the target words in the context of what the speaker is
&gt; saying. </p>
<ul>
<li>Assume that the listener has seen the stimulus picture.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example</u></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Concept 6: “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>The ball <sup>2</sup>breaks <sup>3</sup>a lamp.</em></strong>”</p>
<ul>
<li>“knocked over a <strong>lap</strong> in the man’s house after going
&gt; through the window”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Concept 3: <strong><em><sup>1</sup>The ball <sup>2</sup>breaks <sup>3</sup>the</em></strong> man’s/neighbor’s
&gt; <strong><em>window.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“And window ch <strong>bwoke</strong> by ball”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Concept 2: <strong><em><sup>1</sup>A/The boy <sup>2</sup>was playing <sup>3</sup>soccer.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Dah boy <strong>bahlayed</strong> soccer”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

</div>
<div id="inaccurate-nonessential-words-in-accurate-main-concepts" class="section level3" number="14.1.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.1.4</span> <strong><em>Inaccurate</em></strong> <strong><em><span class="math display">\[nonessential\]</span></em></strong> <strong><em>words in accurate main concepts</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If the essential information in a main concept is accurate, but
&gt; inaccurate words also are included in the concept, consider the
&gt; main concept accurate unless the inaccurate words alter essential
&gt; information to make it inaccurate. </p></li>
<li><p><u>Cookie Theft Example -</u> For the main concept “The woman/mother
&gt; is doing dishes”, the following statement would be considered
&gt; accurate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"The woman is drying the dishes with a bath towel"</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though the woman is using a dish towel, the essential
&gt; information is accurate, because “towel” or “cloth” is not
&gt; an essential element.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example -</u> For main concept 4 “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>The man
&gt; <sup>2</sup>is sitting</em></strong> in a chair and/or inside the house”, the
&gt; following statement would be considered accurate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"The man is sitting reading a newspaper"</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though the man is not reading anything, the essential
&gt; information is accurate, and “reading a newspaper” is not
&gt; essential.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“The man sit sofa”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Even though he is sitting in a chair, not on a sofa, the
&gt; essential information is accurate, and “chair” is not
&gt; essential</p></li>
<li><p>(See also above rule for Accuracy/Grammatical form and word
&gt; order for “The man sit” portion of this production)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Cinderella Examples</u> - For main concept 19: “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>The prince
&gt; and Cinderella <sup>2</sup>danced</em></strong> around the room/all night/with no one
&gt; else”, the following statement would be considered inaccurate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"Um… man i-is dancing da teacher and Cinderella um dances
&gt; on"</p>
<ul>
<li>teacher replaces man, which makes it incorrect because it's
&gt; not the prince, but Cinderella and the verb dancing are
&gt; present, completing all the elements.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="effects-of-statement-form-on-essential-information" class="section level3" number="14.1.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.1.5</span> <strong><em>Effects of statement form on essential information</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The form in which a speaker chooses to state a main concept affects
&gt; which information is considered essential. </p></li>
<li><p><u>Cookie Theft Example -</u> Not provided by Nicholas &amp; Brookshire
&gt; (1995). (The example they give in their appendix is for the
&gt; procedure of how to do dishes.)</p></li>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example -</u> We haven’t actually seen an example
&gt; of this.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Refused Umbrella Example</u> - for main concept 2 “The mother
&gt; says <strong><em><sup>1</sup>you <sup>2</sup>need to take <sup>3</sup>the umbrella</em></strong>”, the following
&gt; would be considered accurate (see checklist, Note 1):</p>
<ul>
<li>“<strong><em><sup>2</sup></em></strong>Take this <strong><em><sup>3</sup></em></strong>umbrella”, since English allows the
&gt; subject to be dropped in a command.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="inaccurate-pronoun-referents" class="section level3" number="14.1.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.1.6</span> <strong><em>Inaccurate pronoun referents</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If a referent is inaccurate but a pronoun that refers to it is
&gt; accurate, consider the statement with the pronoun accurate. </p></li>
<li><p><u>Cookie Theft Example -</u> For the main concept “The woman is
&gt; doing dishes” if the following statements were made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"The man is washing dishes. She is not paying attention to her
&gt; kids"</p>
<ul>
<li>The first statement would be considered inaccurate but the
&gt; second would be considered accurate.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example -</u> For main concept 7 “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>The man
&gt; <sup>2</sup>picks up <sup>3</sup>the ball</em></strong>” if the following statements were made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"The woman picks up the ball. He looks out the window."</p>
<ul>
<li>The first statement would be considered inaccurate but the
&gt; second statement would be considered accurate because the
&gt; pronoun correctly refers to a male.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="restatement-of-essential-information" class="section level3" number="14.1.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.1.7</span> <strong><em>Restatement of essential information</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If essential information is stated one way and then restated, score
&gt; the final version spoken. </p></li>
<li><p><u>Cookie Theft Example -</u> for the main concept “The woman is
&gt; doing the dishes” if the following statements were made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"The woman, he is doing the dishes." This statement would be
&gt; considered inaccurate.</p></li>
<li><p>"The man no woman is doing the dishes," the statement would be
&gt; considered accurate.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example</u> - for main concept 2 “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>A/The boy
&gt; <sup>2</sup>was playing <sup>3</sup>soccer.</em></strong>” if the following statements were
&gt; made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“The boy is playing baseball, no, soccer,” the statement would
&gt; be considered accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>“The boy was kicking a soccer ball. And the ball goes way up
&gt; high. So the boy was playing baseball.”</p>
<ul>
<li>You would score “The boy was playing baseball” for main
&gt; concept 2, because this is a restatement of the first
&gt; utterance, even though it results in a lower score.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Refused Umbrella Example</u> - individuals with more cognitive
&gt; involvement may not realize/express their understanding at first
&gt; that the mother has offered the umbrella (main concept 2) and that
&gt; the boy has refused it (main concept 3), but may correct
&gt; themselves when they get to the bottom panel (pictures 4-6). They
&gt; may then go back and revise their statements and these revisions
&gt; (the final versions) would be what is scored.</p>
<ul>
<li>(This may mean that they end up scoring quite well for main
&gt; concepts, but you should make a notation somewhere that this
&gt; individual “missed” the gist, which was NOT commonly observed
&gt; in controls OR PWAs, and may warrant further assessment of
&gt; cognitive abilities/inference.)</li>

<li>“She lost her dad”, “Her dad died”, because this was the

<li><p>For main concept 8 “King announces <strong><em><sup>1</sup>there is going to be
&gt; <sup>2</sup>a ball</em></strong> in honor of son who needs to find a wife.” or
&gt; main concept 17 “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>Cinderella <sup>2</sup>went <sup>3</sup>to the ball</em></strong> in
&gt; the coach”, the following statement could be credited towards
&gt; one of those concepts, depending on where/when in the episodic
&gt; structure the person produces the utterance:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Then …. ball”, because this introduces/establishes a
&gt; major element of this story</li>
</ul></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.2.3</span> <strong><em>Nonspecific words</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If nonspecific words are spoken in place of essential information,
&gt; consider the main concept incomplete. </p></li>
<li><p><u>Cookie Theft Example -</u> For the main concept “The woman is
&gt; washing the dishes”, the following statement would be incomplete:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"The woman is washing that thing."</p>
<ul>
<li>*BUT* In some cases there may be legitimate uncertainty
&gt; about a specific person or element in a picture (e.g.,
&gt; "Someone is fishing" <span class="math display">\[WAB Picnic Scene\]</span>). In such
&gt; instances, the nonspecific word will appear on the main
&gt; concept list and its use will not render the main concept
&gt; incomplete.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example -</u> For main concept 4: **“<em><sup>1</sup>The man
&gt; <sup>2</sup>is sitting</em>** in a chair and/or inside the house”, the
&gt; following statement would be incomplete:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Someone is in the house.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Cat Rescue/Cat in the Tree Example</u> - For main concept 8:
&gt; “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>Someone <sup>2</sup>called <sup>3</sup>the fire department</em></strong>.”</p>
<ul>
<li>This action is not pictured in the stimulus, so there is
&gt; legitimate uncertainty about who calls. A reference to any
&gt; person would be appropriate here, or the use of a nonspecific
&gt; “somebody” or “someone”. (Examples are provided in the
&gt; published checklist)</li>

<div id="pronoun-referents" class="section level3" number="14.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.2.4</span> <strong><em>Pronoun referents</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If the referent for a pronoun is ambiguous, consider the main
&gt; concept that contains the ambiguous pronoun incomplete, <em><u>but only
&gt; for the first use of the pronoun for that referent </u></em></p></li>
<li><p>Do not consider a main concept incomplete if there is no antecedent
&gt; referent for a pronoun but the referent is clear from
&gt; context/unambiguous. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if there is only one "she" or "he" or "they"
&gt; in a picture, or only one figure is completing a specific
&gt; action, the pronoun would be unambiguous without an antecedent
&gt; referent. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Cookie Theft Example –</u> For the main concept “The boy is
&gt; falling off the stool” the following utterance is complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>“He is about to fall.” This is unambiguous without a referent
&gt; because the only male figure in the picture is the little boy
&gt; standing on the stool.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example -</u> For main concept 4 “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>The man
&gt; <sup>2</sup>is sitting</em></strong> in a chair and/or inside the house” the following
&gt; utterance is complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>“He is sitting inside.” This is unambiguous because there is
&gt; only one person pictured inside the house.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Cinderella Examples</u></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Concept 2: <strong>Cinderella lives with stepmother/stepsisters.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does “they combined families” count?</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>If “they” is referring to some set of individuals that
&gt; clearly includes Cinderella, then this could be
&gt; interpreted similarly to “Cinderella/she has new
&gt; family”, which would be allowed and would AC.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>However, if “they” is unclear or if “they” is referring
&gt; only to the father and the stepmother, this does not
&gt; apply to this concept, it is a separate concept, and
&gt; this would receive the code of AB.</em></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Does “When they brought Cinderella home…” count?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>AC as long as appropriate pronoun referent; This seems
&gt; to be most similar to a restructuring of acceptable
&gt; alternatives of she/Cinderella (1), moves in with (2),
&gt; new family/they (3).</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Pronouns/antecedents: How stringent are the criteria for
&gt; ensuring that the pronouns are unambiguous? If there is
&gt; syntactic ambiguity regarding who went to the ball (e.g., in
&gt; some cases “she went to the ball” could syntactically be
&gt; either Cinderella or the Godmother), is that counted as
&gt; incorrect even though it may be assumed shared knowledge that
&gt; Cinderella went to the ball?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We allowed shared knowledge in those instances, so we would
&gt; score that as AC, as long as both Cinderella and the Fairy
&gt; Godmother had been mentioned (guided by Nicholas and
&gt; Brookshire rules)</em></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.3</span> Additional Notes on Nicholas and Brookshire Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Main concepts do not have to be spoken in the same order they are
&gt; shown in the main concept list.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example</u></p>
<ul>
<li><p>“There is a little boy playing soccer, he’s outside in the
&gt; yard”</p>
<ul>
<li>MC2 is produced first and should be coded as AC. MC1 is
&gt; produced second and should also be coded as AC.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If a main concept is spoken several times, ALWAYS score the final
&gt; version.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example</u></p>
<ul>
<li><p>“<em>The boy is playing soccer, practicing for the team
&gt; try-outs, so he’s kicking the ball, and it goes right
&gt; through the window</em>”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both “<em>the boy is playing soccer</em>” and “<em>he’s kicking
&gt; the ball</em>” apply to MC2. Since, “<em>he’s kicking the
&gt; ball</em>” is produced later, that is the utterance that
&gt; should be scored for MC2.</p></li>
<li><p>This is true even if the later utterance results in an
&gt; error code, while the first utterance would receive an
&gt; AC code.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Essential elements for main concepts can be produced across multiple
&gt; utterances.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are many different criteria used to segment discourse into
&gt; utterances. Practicing clinicians may not have the time or
&gt; training on specific segmenting approaches. If essential
&gt; elements are produced within a reasonable distance within a
&gt; string of words, regardless of where utterance boundaries may
&gt; be placed, they can still count towards a single main concept.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example -</u> for main concept 8: “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>The
&gt; man <sup>2</sup>looked <sup>3</sup>out of the window.</em></strong>” the following
&gt; utterances can be scored together:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Utterance 1: “<em>man gets up.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Utterance 2: “<em>mad mad mad.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Utterance 3: “<em>looks out the window.</em></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The verb tense used in the production should <strong>not</strong> impact the code
&gt; received. Any inflected form of the verbs listed in the checklist
&gt; should be allowed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example -</u> for main concept 8: “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>The
&gt; man <sup>2</sup>looked <sup>3</sup>out of the window.</em></strong>” the following
&gt; utterances would be accurate and complete:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“the man is looking outside”</p></li>
<li><p>“so the man will go look out the glass to see who’s there”</p></li>
<li><p>“the man looks out the window”</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>One utterance can be used to produce two or more main concepts</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Broken Window Example -</u> for main concept 7 “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>The man
&gt; <sup>2</sup>picks up <sup>3</sup>the ball.</em></strong>” and 8 “<strong><em><sup>1</sup>The man <sup>2</sup>looked
&gt; <sup>3</sup>out of the window.</em></strong>” the following statement would be
&gt; accurate and complete:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“the man picks up the ball and looks out.”</p></li>
<li><p>“the man looks out the window holding the ball.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>OTHER EXAMPLES, TO BE FILED UNDER CORRECT ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS RULE</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Cinderella Examples</u></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Concept 1: <strong>Dad remarried a woman</strong> with two daughters.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>OK if this spans 2 utterances? (e.g., The dad remarried. The
&gt; woman was mean…)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>We would score “the dad remarried” as AI – The object
&gt; of the sentence is missing. “The woman was mean” was
&gt; actually a separate concept that is seen represented
&gt; in the 3<sup>rd</sup> concept in the appendix.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>We have had disagreement over this, as we have stated
&gt; that MCs can span utterances, and since there is a
&gt; clear inference/relationship in this example.</em></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Concept 18: She knew <strong>she had to be home by midnight</strong> because
&gt; everything will turn back at midnight.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Does “Had to be back by midnight” count?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>would code as AC, assuming there was a subject; if no
&gt; subject, then AI</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Concept 10: <strong>Cinderella</strong> is told by the stepmother she
&gt; <strong>cannot go</strong> to the ball unless/because (insert reason)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Would “And Cinderella um go no” count as complete for this?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Scored as AI, however, it matters if the patient
&gt; intends “no” as a revision</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>There are examples in Richardson &amp; Dalton (2016) of how to code
&gt; utterances where verbs are omitted (i.e., “Mother dishes” is
&gt; AI), but none where a subject is omitted. Is it necessary for
&gt; an utterance to have a subject to be an MC? Or could an
&gt; utterance be coded as AI/II if it is missing the subject but
&gt; contains other essential components?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>A STATEMENT DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE A SUBJECT TO BE CODED AS
&gt; AN MC, IT CAN BE GIVEN AN AI/II CODE AS APPROPRIATE.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>How does more complex syntax influence the interpretation of
&gt; MCs? Specifically, what do you do if the participant uses a
&gt; compound predicate; can this count as 2 MCs with the common
&gt; subject (e.g., “Cinderella lives with her stepmother and
&gt; stepsisters and had to do all the housework for them.”)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>WE WOULD GIVE CREDIT FOR BOTH MCs. BOTH WOULD RECEIVE AN
&gt; "AC".</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>What if the MC subject is an object of a sentence with a verb
&gt; clause following it that includes the MC verb/object (e.g.,
&gt; “there was a girl named Cinderella who lived with her
&gt; stepmother and stepsisters.”)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>IN THE SECOND INSTANCE, WE WOULD GIVE CREDIT FOR MC2 FOR
&gt; THE VERB CLAUSE. "WHO" CLEARLY REFERENCES CINDERELLA IN
&gt; THE MAIN CLAUSE, SO THE PARTICIPANT SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED
&gt; THE SUBJECT (WHO = CINDERELLA), VERB (LIVED), AND
&gt; ADDITIONAL INFO (WITH STEPMOM/STEPSISTERS). WE WOULD CODE
&gt; THIS AS AN "AC" FOR MC2.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>How much of an utterance is needed to count as a main concept?
&gt; “At the strike of midnight” has no subject and no verb, but
&gt; includes “strike” (as a noun) and “midnight” – two of the
&gt; essential elements from MC 21. Does this still count as MC
&gt; 21?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>WE WOULD COUNT THIS AS MC 21. THIS GOES BACK TO THE
&gt; NICHOLAS &amp; BROOKSHIRE RULE THAT SAYS THAT THE FORMULATION
&gt; OF THE MC CAN IMPACT WHAT IS CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL. SINCE
&gt; THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE FORMULATION IN ENGLISH TO EXPRESS
&gt; THE CONCEPT OF IT BEING MIDNIGHT, IT WOULD BE SCORED AS
&gt; "AC".</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>How do you count subordinate clauses that do have a separate
&gt; verb from the main clause? Can the subordinate clause stand on
&gt; its own as an MC? (e.g., “Cinderella lives with her stepmother
&gt; and stepsisters who are very mean to her”)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>YES, WE WOULD ALLOW THIS STATEMENT TO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR
&gt; BOTH MC2 AND MC3.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>How do you handle situations in which an utterance clearly
&gt; relates to an MC, but is formulated with different words? Do
&gt; you handle it differently if the utterance requires an
&gt; inference to understand how it is related? (e.g., “her dad
&gt; introduces Cinderella to his new wife” – implies he got
&gt; re-married <span class="math display">\[MC1\]</span>; “the king is upset that his son hasn’t
&gt; married” – implies the king thinks his son should get married
&gt; <span class="math display">\[MC6\]</span>; “one of the caveats of the fairy’s spell is that it
&gt; ended at midnight” – implies <span class="math display">\[MC18\]</span>)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>THESE EXAMPLES SHOULD NOT COUNT TOWARDS THE MCs YOU
&gt; IDENTIFIED, AS IT REQUIRES TOO MUCH INFERENCE AND DOES NOT
&gt; DIRECTLY EXPRESS THE GIST; ALSO, IN OUR NORMING SAMPLE,
&gt; EACH OF THOSE STATEMENTS WERE RELEVANT CONCEPTS THAT DID
&gt; NOT REACH THE CUT-OFF TO BE CONSIDERED MCs.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>BUT SEE RULE FOR COMPLETENESS/<strong>Statements containing some
&gt; of the essential information</strong></em></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>TO BE ANSWERED</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Concept 3: Stepmother and/or stepsisters were mean to Cinderella</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“They didn’t really give her enough attention”</p></li>
<li><p>What is the strength of "giving enough attention" and how does
&gt; it relate to main concept of "being mean" ?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Concept 4: Cinderella was a servant to the stepmother and
&gt; stepsisters.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“She was white trash”</p></li>
<li><p>Is white trash similar enough to being lesser than, but not
&gt; similar enough to servitude? OR is it just a statement that is
&gt; being made by the participant and it doesn't really
&gt; add/contribute to the main concept?</p></li>
