[["index.html", "Main Concept Analysis 1 Introduction", " Main Concept Analysis 1 Introduction Main Concept Analysis (MCA) is a discourse assessment originally developed by Nicholas and Brookshire (1995) that measures the informativeness of a discourse sample on a given topic. Main concept checklists for several widely used tasks (including picture description, picture sequence, story retell, and procedural stimuli) have been developed based on discourse samples of control speakers (Richardson &amp; Dalton, 2016; 2020). MCA is a hybrid discourse measure that provides some information on micro-linguistic features of the discourse sample as well as more macro-linguistic features about the overall adequacy of the discourse sample to communicate an intended message. MCA has shown good sensitivity in differentiating between controls and individuals with communication disorders (e.g., Kong, Whiteside, &amp; Bargmann, 2016; Dalton &amp; Richardson, 2019) and between individuals with fluent and non-fluent aphasia (Kong et al., 2016). Importantly, studies have shown that changes in informativeness are associated with treatment performance (Albright &amp; Purves, 2008; Avent &amp; Austermann, 2003; Coelho, McHugh, &amp; Boyle, 2000; Cupit, Rochon, Leonard, &amp; Laird, 2010; Stark, 2010) and are associated with listener’s perceptions of communication quality (Cupit et al., 2010; Ross &amp; Wertz, 1999). Each main concept consists of several essential elements, corresponding to the subject, main verb, object (if appropriate), and any subordinate clauses (Nicholas &amp; Brookshire, 1995). The main concept is assigned one of 5 codes depending on the accuracy (are the essential elements accurate?) and completeness (are essential elements present?) of the production. Coding: AC = accurate and complete = contains all elements of the main &gt; concept on the checklist with no incorrect information AI = accurate and incomplete = contains no incorrect information, &gt; but leaves out at least one essential element of the main concept &gt; on the checklist IC = inaccurate and complete = contains at least one incorrect piece &gt; of essential information (e.g., “knight” for “prince”) but &gt; includes all essential elements of the main concept on the &gt; checklist II = inaccurate and incomplete = clearly corresponds with a main &gt; concept on the checklist but includes at least one incorrect &gt; essential element and fails to include at least one essential &gt; element AB = absent = did not produce the main concept Scoring*: Richardson and Dalton, 2016 Kong, 2009 Accurate &amp; Complete (AC): 3 Points Accurate &amp; Complete (AC): 3 Points Accurate &amp; Incomplete (AI): 2 Points Accurate &amp; Incomplete (AI): 2 Point Inaccurate &amp; Complete (IC): 2 Points Inaccurate (I, IC and II): 1 Point Inaccurate &amp; Incomplete (II): 1 Point Absent (AB): 0 Points Absent (AB): 0 Points *To our knowledge, norms for AphasiaBank stimuli are only available for the Richardson &amp; Dalton 2016 scoring system. If using the Kong, 2009 system, scores cannot be compared to the Richardson &amp; Dalton 2016 norms. See Kong et al., 2016 for main concepts, checklists, and norms for additional stimuli. Nicholas and Brookshire also developed a series of coding rules to assist in determining the accuracy and completeness of main concepts. These coding rules are now supplemented with the published checklists, which provide common alternatives produced for each main concept, since there is variability in the syntax and vocabulary that could be used to produce a main concept. These alternative lists are not comprehensive, so it is possible that a client may produce an acceptable alternative that is not in the checklist. Note to Remember: Main concepts do not have to be given in the transcript in the same &gt; order they are shown in the main concept list. Cinderella Example Concept: 18. She knew she had to be home by midnight &gt; because everything will turn back at midnight. What if this occurs later in the story (e.g., after #21 &gt; – something like “she heard the clock and knew she &gt; had to be home by midnight”) Yes, we would still allow that to count. There &gt; seemed to be a couple of “typical” orderings of &gt; MCs. We went with the most frequent when ordering &gt; our list. More/updated information on sequencing for &gt; Cinderella is available via Greenslade et al., &gt; 2020 - &gt; https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_AJSLP-19-00151 If a main concept is spoken several times, score the final version. Essential elements can be produced across multiple utterances.

Pumpkin and mice OR carriage/coach and horses i. When producing this concept, only one pair needs to be mentioned, however, it must be correctly paired to receive full credit a. Pumpkin carriage/coach (and horses) b. Mice horses (and carriage) c. If they initially mention both pumpkin and mice, they do not necessarily have to mention both after the transformation occurs in order to receive full credit, and only one needs to be accurate d. Do not take points off for mentioning other transformations, such as dog coachman as these are not incorrect, they simply did not reach significance. 16) 1The fairy godmother 2makes 3Cinderella 4into a beautiful princess. †† 1.

If the speaker does not say “together” they must give some indication that the two pieces become one (i.e., “Put one piece on top of the other”, “Combine the pieces of bread”, “Put the second piece of bread on top.”) i. The verbs “fold” and “close” cannot be used for this concept, unless the speaker tells the entire story with one piece of bread as if making half of a sandwich, see 2.2.i. 10) 1Cut 2the sandwich 3in pieces. 1. Slice 2. The bread, it 3. In half, in quarters, in two, diagonally, across, on the bias, down the middle, with an x, however you like Note: For concepts 1-5, “put” is not an acceptable verb. For each of those concepts there was a similar relevant concept (i.e., “put the bread on the counter”), however, none of these relevant concepts reached criterion. In these cases, the speaker would receive a score of absent, and any information associated with the verb “put” should be treated as extra information that is not scored.

Each essential segment is numbered (superscript) with alternative productions (if any were produced) listed by number below. These alternative productions are not intended to be an exhaustive list but represent some of the more common productions of the normative sample and are included to aid in scoring. Additional, but non-essential, information often spoken to complete the main concept is in normal font. Healthy control speakers often used reported speech (e.g., one of the characters speaking to the other) in order to tell this story. Main Concepts that are produced as reported speech should be scored for the corresponding concept, even if the reported speech causes the concept to be stated in a different format than that reported below. Additionally, during interactions between the mother and boy, main concepts were often expressed from either character’s perspective. 1. The mother says 1it’s going to 2rain today. † 1.1. It’s supposed to, it might, it’s predicted, it looks like, there’s a chance 1.2. Sprinkle, drizzle, storm Note 1: Occasionally produced as “2Rain 1is in the forecast.” Note 2: Statements that implied bad weather was on the way e.g. “the weather was looking gray and cloudy outside” do not count towards this MC as it was another relevant concept that did not meet threshold. Note 3: The statement “It is raining.” does not apply to this MC; see MC 5. 2. The mother says 1you 2need to take 3the umbrella. †† 2.1. He (if appropriate referent), the boy, (male name) 2.2. Carry, take, have, need, should have, might need, might want Note 1: Sometimes produced as a command with the subject implied, e.g., “take this umbrella” these statements were considered AC since English allows the subject to be dropped in a command. Note 2: Sometimes produced as “1his mother 2offers him 3an umbrella.” or similar. Note 3: Occasionally produced as a question “don't 1you 2want to take 3this umbrella?” Note 4: Sometimes produced “2here is 1your 3umbrella.” 3. 1The boy 2(does something to refuse) 3the umbrella. †† 3.1. He (if appropriate referent), the boy, (male name), I (if reported speech) 3.2. Doesn’t want, refuses, won’t/is not going to take, declines, says no, says he’ll be ok without 3.3. It (if appropriate referent) Note: Occasionally this concept was stated as “He won’t do it.” in reference to the mother trying to make him take the umbrella, so the action he “won’t do” is “take the umbrella” and this should receive an AC as long as the referent is produced. 4. 1The boy 2walks 3to school. †† 4.1. See 3.1, a child 4.2. Goes, leaves, heads, takes off, starts, sets 4.3. Outside, out of the house, out, to/for/towards \\[location\\], down the road, off, out of the door, further, forth, down, in the rain Note: Sometimes the order of elements was switched, e.g. “3Off to school 1he 2goes” 5. 1It 2is raining. †† 5.1. The rain, the deluge 5.2. Starts to pour, starts coming down, is falling, is sprinkling, gets harder, gets heavier, is raining, begins to rain, starts to rain, starts falling, comes, is coming down, starts raining, started sprinkling, started, rained Note 1: Sometimes produced as a colloquialism, “The sky opens up” or “We have a downpour.” Note 2: Occasionally produced as “Here 2comes 1the rain.” Note 3: Do not count utterances about rain “increasing” in severity (e.g., “It starts to rain harder.”). 6. 1The boy 2gets 3soaking wet. †† 6.1. See 3.1 6.2. Is, looks, stands there 6.3. Soaked, drenched, dripping, very wet Note: Sometimes speakers would use first person (e.g. “1I 2am 3all wet”) 7. 1The boy 2runs 3back. †† 7.1. See 3.1 7.2. Goes, heads, returns, turns around, races, rushes, comes, gets, arrives, shows 7.3. Home, inside Note: Occasionally combined with MC 6 as in, “The boy runs back soaking wet.” A person who says this should receive full credit for MCs 6 and 7. 8. 1The mother 2is 3(negative emotional state). 8.1. The woman, she, the lady, mom 8.2. looks, feels 8.3. unhappy, mad, angry, upset, annoyed, frustrated, concerned, cross, disappointed Note 1: Sometimes reported as “his mother doesn’t look happy.” Note 2: Statements about physical stance/nonverbal expression do not count, e.g., “She’s scowling.” Note 3: Occasionally combined with MC 6 and MC 7 as in “When the boy came back home, mom was mad because he was all wet.” A person who says this should receive full credit for MCs 6, 7, and 8. 9. 1The boy 2gets 3an umbrella. †† 9.1. see 3.1 9.2. takes, receives, has, asks for, carries, retrieves, picks up, holds 9.3. it (if appropriate referent) Note: Sometimes produced as “The mother 2gives 1the boy 3an umbrella.” Or “she 2gave 3it to 1him.” (if appropriate referents). 10. 1The boy 2goes 3back to school. †† 10.1. see 3.1 10.2. walks, leaves, heads, starts, takes, is, sets forth, proceeds 10.3. out, again, along, back, in the rain, off, on his way, with the umbrella, (leaves) the house, the school bus Note 1: Sometimes produced as “3Off 1he 2goes again.” Note 2: Occasionally combined with MC 9, as in “He goes out with the umbrella.” A person who says this should receive full credit for MCs 9 and 10. † Indicates concepts produced by 50% of the normative sample †† Indicates concepts produced by 66% of the normative sample "],["nicholas-brookshire-coding-rules-with-examples-from-richardson-dalton.html", "14 Nicholas &amp; Brookshire Coding Rules with Examples from Richardson &amp; Dalton 14.1 Accuracy 14.2 Completeness 14.3 Additional Notes on Nicholas and Brookshire Rules", " 14 Nicholas &amp; Brookshire Coding Rules with Examples from Richardson &amp; Dalton 14.1 Accuracy 14.1.1 Wording The wording of essential information does not have to be the same as &gt; that of the listed main concept, but the general meaning must be &gt; the same. Some alternate versions of essential information in specific &gt; main concepts are given in parentheses in the main concept &gt; lists. There may be appropriate alternatives not listed. Figures of speech and colloquialisms are acceptable. Cookie Theft Example - For the main concept, \"The woman is &gt; doing the dishes,\" the following statements would be considered &gt; accurate because they are plausible given the stimulus picture: The mother is cleaning the dishes. The maid is drying a plate. The lady was washing her dishes. Broken Window Example – For main concept 4 “1The man &gt; 2is sitting in a chair and/or inside the house”, the &gt; following statements would be considered accurate. The father is relaxing in his recliner. The neighbor is sitting in the living room. The man is resting and watching TV. The man is sitting. He is just sitting there. (as long as “he” is not ambiguous, &gt; e.g., pointing to third frame, or following a sentence like &gt; “That must be the neighbor. He is just sitting there.”, etc.) Cinderella Examples Concept 1: Dad remarried a woman with two daughters. Is married OK, or does it have to say ‘remarried’? Married is ok. There does not have to be some &gt; indication of repetition – the first choice in the &gt; appendix is “got married to” which does not require &gt; some indication of repetition Concept 3: 1Stepmother/ stepsisters 2were mean 3to &gt; Cinderella. Does “they treated her like dirt” count? If “her” clearly references Cinderella based on &gt; transcript, and “they” clearly reference the &gt; stepmother and/or stepsisters, “like dirt” matches the &gt; alternative productions in terms of semantic meaning, &gt; so this would be accurate (and complete) Does “her mother was kind of mean to her” count? If they do not mention the word “step”, there must &gt; be/have been some indication that the stepmother is a &gt; unit separate from Cinderella; mother here implies &gt; “real” or “biological” mother, which would be &gt; inaccurate It could also be argued that “kind of mean” is not the &gt; same as the options indicated in the checklist - &gt; “mean, cruel, wicked, treated Cinderella poorly, were &gt; awful, hated” - but this may be too subjective Concept 5: Cinderella has to do all the housework “Had some chores that she should do” Because verb \"should\" is a suggestion, and not a verb &gt; portraying that does not leave a choice/force/control, &gt; it changes the meaning. THIS IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND &gt; A RULE WITH FREQUENT DISAGREEMENT Concept 8. They got an invitation to the ball. “there was an announcement about a ball” (assuming not OK, &gt; as there was no alternative for ‘invitation’) You are correct, invitation was the only word used for &gt; this concept. “announcement about a ball” could be &gt; applied to MC7 though (King announces there is going &gt; to be a ball in honor of son who needs to find a &gt; wife.) Concept 11: The stepsisters tore Cinderella’s dress. Does it have to be the dress or can “tore jewelry” count? We have accepted jewelry in the past though no other &gt; alternatives are listed in the appendix, it is &gt; something that is torn and is visible in the picture &gt; book as well, and we didn’t explicitly say “no &gt; alternatives were produced”, as we did for &gt; invitation. Concept 21: Cinderella realized it is midnight. Does “at midnight she had to run away” count? Yes, this would count Concept 22: She ran down the stairs. “she ran off” – does this count? Or does it have to be “ran &gt; away” or “ran out”? “off” would count 14.1.2 Grammatical form and word order Essential information does not have to be spoken in standard &gt; grammatical form or standard word order, as long as deviations &gt; would not lead to miscomprehension of the essential meaning of the &gt; main concept. Cookie Theft Example - For the main concept, \"The woman is &gt; doing the dishes,\" the following statements would be considered &gt; accurate: Mother do dishes. Lady drying some plate. Woman dishes drying them. Broken Window Example – For main concept 6 “1The ball &gt; 2breaks 3a lamp.” the following statements would be &gt; considered accurate. Ball break lamp(s). Ball lamp broken. Lamp is broken um ball boom. 14.1.3 Articulation Essential words do not have to be correctly articulated to be &gt; considered accurate, as long as they would be intelligible to a &gt; listener as the target words in the context of what the speaker is &gt; saying. Assume that the listener has seen the stimulus picture. Broken Window Example Concept 6: “1The ball 2breaks 3a lamp.” “knocked over a lap in the man’s house after going &gt; through the window” Concept 3: 1The ball 2breaks 3the man’s/neighbor’s &gt; window. “And window ch bwoke by ball” Concept 2: 1A/The boy 2was playing 3soccer. “Dah boy bahlayed soccer” 14.1.4 Inaccurate \\[nonessential\\] words in accurate main concepts If the essential information in a main concept is accurate, but &gt; inaccurate words also are included in the concept, consider the &gt; main concept accurate unless the inaccurate words alter essential &gt; information to make it inaccurate. Cookie Theft Example - For the main concept “The woman/mother &gt; is doing dishes”, the following statement would be considered &gt; accurate: \"The woman is drying the dishes with a bath towel\" Even though the woman is using a dish towel, the essential &gt; information is accurate, because “towel” or “cloth” is not &gt; an essential element. Broken Window Example - For main concept 4 “1The man &gt; 2is sitting in a chair and/or inside the house”, the &gt; following statement would be considered accurate: \"The man is sitting reading a newspaper\" Even though the man is not reading anything, the essential &gt; information is accurate, and “reading a newspaper” is not &gt; essential. “The man sit sofa” Even though he is sitting in a chair, not on a sofa, the &gt; essential information is accurate, and “chair” is not &gt; essential (See also above rule for Accuracy/Grammatical form and word &gt; order for “The man sit” portion of this production) Cinderella Examples - For main concept 19: “1The prince &gt; and Cinderella 2danced around the room/all night/with no one &gt; else”, the following statement would be considered inaccurate: \"Um… man i-is dancing da teacher and Cinderella um dances &gt; on\" teacher replaces man, which makes it incorrect because it's &gt; not the prince, but Cinderella and the verb dancing are &gt; present, completing all the elements. 14.1.5 Effects of statement form on essential information The form in which a speaker chooses to state a main concept affects &gt; which information is considered essential. Cookie Theft Example - Not provided by Nicholas &amp; Brookshire &gt; (1995). (The example they give in their appendix is for the &gt; procedure of how to do dishes.) Broken Window Example - We haven’t actually seen an example &gt; of this. Refused Umbrella Example - for main concept 2 “The mother &gt; says 1you 2need to take 3the umbrella”, the following &gt; would be considered accurate (see checklist, Note 1): “2Take this 3umbrella”, since English allows the &gt; subject to be dropped in a command. 14.1.6 Inaccurate pronoun referents If a referent is inaccurate but a pronoun that refers to it is &gt; accurate, consider the statement with the pronoun accurate. Cookie Theft Example - For the main concept “The woman is &gt; doing dishes” if the following statements were made: \"The man is washing dishes. She is not paying attention to her &gt; kids\" The first statement would be considered inaccurate but the &gt; second would be considered accurate. Broken Window Example - For main concept 7 “1The man &gt; 2picks up 3the ball” if the following statements were made: \"The woman picks up the ball. He looks out the window.\" The first statement would be considered inaccurate but the &gt; second statement would be considered accurate because the &gt; pronoun correctly refers to a male. 14.1.7 Restatement of essential information If essential information is stated one way and then restated, score &gt; the final version spoken. Cookie Theft Example - for the main concept “The woman is &gt; doing the dishes” if the following statements were made: \"The woman, he is doing the dishes.\" This statement would be &gt; considered inaccurate. \"The man no woman is doing the dishes,\" the statement would be &gt; considered accurate. Broken Window Example - for main concept 2 “1A/The boy &gt; 2was playing 3soccer.” if the following statements were &gt; made: “The boy is playing baseball, no, soccer,” the statement would &gt; be considered accurate. “The boy was kicking a soccer ball. And the ball goes way up &gt; high. So the boy was playing baseball.” You would score “The boy was playing baseball” for main &gt; concept 2, because this is a restatement of the first &gt; utterance, even though it results in a lower score. Refused Umbrella Example - individuals with more cognitive &gt; involvement may not realize/express their understanding at first &gt; that the mother has offered the umbrella (main concept 2) and that &gt; the boy has refused it (main concept 3), but may correct &gt; themselves when they get to the bottom panel (pictures 4-6). They &gt; may then go back and revise their statements and these revisions &gt; (the final versions) would be what is scored. (This may mean that they end up scoring quite well for main &gt; concepts, but you should make a notation somewhere that this &gt; individual “missed” the gist, which was NOT commonly observed &gt; in controls OR PWAs, and may warrant further assessment of &gt; cognitive abilities/inference.) 14.2 Completeness 14.2.1 Missing essential information If only some of the essential information (bold italicized) &gt; for a main concept is mentioned, either in its list form or in a &gt; form that has the same general meaning, consider the main concept &gt; incomplete. Broken Window Example - For main concept 2: “1A/The boy &gt; 2was playing 3soccer” the following statements would be &gt; incomplete: “The boy is playing.” “The boy soccer ball.” Cinderella Example - For main concept 22: “1She 2ran &gt; 3down the stairs” the following statement would be &gt; incomplete: “And she had to run.” “she” is correct, if there is a clear pronoun referent or if &gt; it is not ambiguous; “run” is present; what is missing is &gt; “down the stairs” (or some acceptable alternative, e.g., &gt; out of the ball, away from the castle/prince/ball, out, &gt; away, etc.) 14.2.2 Statements containing some of the essential information If a statement that is not listed as a main concept contains some of &gt; the essential information for a main concept, consider the main &gt; concept incomplete. Cookie Theft Example - For the main concept “The woman is &gt; doing the dishes” the following utterance would be considered &gt; incomplete: \"The woman is standing there\". This would be the case as &gt; long as \"woman\" was not counted toward another main concept &gt; and the character has not been mentioned previously. Such &gt; statements serve to establish a character, element, or action &gt; in a story. Broken Window Examples For main concept 4: **“1The man 2is sitting** in a chair &gt; and/or inside the house.” the following statement would be &gt; incomplete: “The ball hit a man.” For main concept 2: “1A/The boy 2was playing &gt; 3soccer” the following statement would be incomplete: “It is a ball.” Cinderella Examples For main concept 1 “1Dad 2remarried 3a woman with &gt; two daughters.”, the following statement would be considered &gt; incomplete/credited towards this main concept: “She lost her dad”, “Her dad died”, because this was the &gt; introduction/establishment of a major character of the &gt; story, and no other statements mapped on to this concept. For main concept 8 “King announces 1there is going to be &gt; 2a ball in honor of son who needs to find a wife.” or &gt; main concept 17 “1Cinderella 2went 3to the ball in &gt; the coach”, the following statement could be credited towards &gt; one of those concepts, depending on where/when in the episodic &gt; structure the person produces the utterance: “Then …. ball”, because this introduces/establishes a &gt; major element of this story 14.2.3 Nonspecific words If nonspecific words are spoken in place of essential information, &gt; consider the main concept incomplete. Cookie Theft Example - For the main concept “The woman is &gt; washing the dishes”, the following statement would be incomplete: \"The woman is washing that thing.\" *BUT* In some cases there may be legitimate uncertainty &gt; about a specific person or element in a picture (e.g., &gt; \"Someone is fishing\" \\[WAB Picnic Scene\\]). In such &gt; instances, the nonspecific word will appear on the main &gt; concept list and its use will not render the main concept &gt; incomplete. Broken Window Example - For main concept 4: **“1The man &gt; 2is sitting** in a chair and/or inside the house”, the &gt; following statement would be incomplete: “Someone is in the house.” Cat Rescue/Cat in the Tree Example - For main concept 8: &gt; “1Someone 2called 3the fire department.” This action is not pictured in the stimulus, so there is &gt; legitimate uncertainty about who calls. A reference to any &gt; person would be appropriate here, or the use of a nonspecific &gt; “somebody” or “someone”. (Examples are provided in the &gt; published checklist) 14.2.4 Pronoun referents If the referent for a pronoun is ambiguous, consider the main &gt; concept that contains the ambiguous pronoun incomplete, but only &gt; for the first use of the pronoun for that referent Do not consider a main concept incomplete if there is no antecedent &gt; referent for a pronoun but the referent is clear from &gt; context/unambiguous. For example, if there is only one \"she\" or \"he\" or \"they\" &gt; in a picture, or only one figure is completing a specific &gt; action, the pronoun would be unambiguous without an antecedent &gt; referent. Cookie Theft Example – For the main concept “The boy is &gt; falling off the stool” the following utterance is complete: “He is about to fall.” This is unambiguous without a referent &gt; because the only male figure in the picture is the little boy &gt; standing on the stool. Broken Window Example - For main concept 4 “1The man &gt; 2is sitting in a chair and/or inside the house” the following &gt; utterance is complete: “He is sitting inside.” This is unambiguous because there is &gt; only one person pictured inside the house. Cinderella Examples Concept 2: Cinderella lives with stepmother/stepsisters. Does “they combined families” count? If “they” is referring to some set of individuals that &gt; clearly includes Cinderella, then this could be &gt; interpreted similarly to “Cinderella/she has new &gt; family”, which would be allowed and would AC. However, if “they” is unclear or if “they” is referring &gt; only to the father and the stepmother, this does not &gt; apply to this concept, it is a separate concept, and &gt; this would receive the code of AB. Does “When they brought Cinderella home…” count? AC as long as appropriate pronoun referent; This seems &gt; to be most similar to a restructuring of acceptable &gt; alternatives of she/Cinderella (1), moves in with (2), &gt; new family/they (3). Pronouns/antecedents: How stringent are the criteria for &gt; ensuring that the pronouns are unambiguous? If there is &gt; syntactic ambiguity regarding who went to the ball (e.g., in &gt; some cases “she went to the ball” could syntactically be &gt; either Cinderella or the Godmother), is that counted as &gt; incorrect even though it may be assumed shared knowledge that &gt; Cinderella went to the ball? We allowed shared knowledge in those instances, so we would &gt; score that as AC, as long as both Cinderella and the Fairy &gt; Godmother had been mentioned (guided by Nicholas and &gt; Brookshire rules) 14.3 Additional Notes on Nicholas and Brookshire Rules Main concepts do not have to be spoken in the same order they are &gt; shown in the main concept list. Broken Window Example “There is a little boy playing soccer, he’s outside in the &gt; yard” MC2 is produced first and should be coded as AC. MC1 is &gt; produced second and should also be coded as AC. If a main concept is spoken several times, ALWAYS score the final &gt; version. Broken Window Example “The boy is playing soccer, practicing for the team &gt; try-outs, so he’s kicking the ball, and it goes right &gt; through the window” Both “the boy is playing soccer” and “he’s kicking &gt; the ball” apply to MC2. Since, “he’s kicking the &gt; ball” is produced later, that is the utterance that &gt; should be scored for MC2. This is true even if the later utterance results in an &gt; error code, while the first utterance would receive an &gt; AC code. Essential elements for main concepts can be produced across multiple &gt; utterances. There are many different criteria used to segment discourse into &gt; utterances. Practicing clinicians may not have the time or &gt; training on specific segmenting approaches. If essential &gt; elements are produced within a reasonable distance within a &gt; string of words, regardless of where utterance boundaries may &gt; be placed, they can still count towards a single main concept. Broken Window Example - for main concept 8: “1The &gt; man 2looked 3out of the window.” the following &gt; utterances can be scored together: Utterance 1: “man gets up.” Utterance 2: “mad mad mad.” Utterance 3: “looks out the window. The verb tense used in the production should not impact the code &gt; received. Any inflected form of the verbs listed in the checklist &gt; should be allowed. Broken Window Example - for main concept 8: “1The &gt; man 2looked 3out of the window.” the following &gt; utterances would be accurate and complete: “the man is looking outside” “so the man will go look out the glass to see who’s there” “the man looks out the window” One utterance can be used to produce two or more main concepts Broken Window Example - for main concept 7 “1The man &gt; 2picks up 3the ball.” and 8 “1The man 2looked &gt; 3out of the window.” the following statement would be &gt; accurate and complete: “the man picks up the ball and looks out.” “the man looks out the window holding the ball.” OTHER EXAMPLES, TO BE FILED UNDER CORRECT ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS RULE Cinderella Examples Concept 1: Dad remarried a woman with two daughters. OK if this spans 2 utterances? (e.g., The dad remarried. The &gt; woman was mean…) We would score “the dad remarried” as AI – The object &gt; of the sentence is missing. “The woman was mean” was &gt; actually a separate concept that is seen represented &gt; in the 3rd concept in the appendix. We have had disagreement over this, as we have stated &gt; that MCs can span utterances, and since there is a &gt; clear inference/relationship in this example. Concept 18: She knew she had to be home by midnight because &gt; everything will turn back at midnight. Does “Had to be back by midnight” count? would code as AC, assuming there was a subject; if no &gt; subject, then AI Concept 10: Cinderella is told by the stepmother she &gt; cannot go to the ball unless/because (insert reason) Would “And Cinderella um go no” count as complete for this? Scored as AI, however, it matters if the patient &gt; intends “no” as a revision There are examples in Richardson &amp; Dalton (2016) of how to code &gt; utterances where verbs are omitted (i.e., “Mother dishes” is &gt; AI), but none where a subject is omitted. Is it necessary for &gt; an utterance to have a subject to be an MC? Or could an &gt; utterance be coded as AI/II if it is missing the subject but &gt; contains other essential components? A STATEMENT DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE A SUBJECT TO BE CODED AS &gt; AN MC, IT CAN BE GIVEN AN AI/II CODE AS APPROPRIATE. How does more complex syntax influence the interpretation of &gt; MCs? Specifically, what do you do if the participant uses a &gt; compound predicate; can this count as 2 MCs with the common &gt; subject (e.g., “Cinderella lives with her stepmother and &gt; stepsisters and had to do all the housework for them.”) WE WOULD GIVE CREDIT FOR BOTH MCs. BOTH WOULD RECEIVE AN &gt; \"AC\". What if the MC subject is an object of a sentence with a verb &gt; clause following it that includes the MC verb/object (e.g., &gt; “there was a girl named Cinderella who lived with her &gt; stepmother and stepsisters.”) IN THE SECOND INSTANCE, WE WOULD GIVE CREDIT FOR MC2 FOR &gt; THE VERB CLAUSE. \"WHO\" CLEARLY REFERENCES CINDERELLA IN &gt; THE MAIN CLAUSE, SO THE PARTICIPANT SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED &gt; THE SUBJECT (WHO = CINDERELLA), VERB (LIVED), AND &gt; ADDITIONAL INFO (WITH STEPMOM/STEPSISTERS). WE WOULD CODE &gt; THIS AS AN \"AC\" FOR MC2. How much of an utterance is needed to count as a main concept? &gt; “At the strike of midnight” has no subject and no verb, but &gt; includes “strike” (as a noun) and “midnight” – two of the &gt; essential elements from MC 21. Does this still count as MC &gt; 21? WE WOULD COUNT THIS AS MC 21. THIS GOES BACK TO THE &gt; NICHOLAS &amp; BROOKSHIRE RULE THAT SAYS THAT THE FORMULATION &gt; OF THE MC CAN IMPACT WHAT IS CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL. SINCE &gt; THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE FORMULATION IN ENGLISH TO EXPRESS &gt; THE CONCEPT OF IT BEING MIDNIGHT, IT WOULD BE SCORED AS &gt; \"AC\". How do you count subordinate clauses that do have a separate &gt; verb from the main clause? Can the subordinate clause stand on &gt; its own as an MC? (e.g., “Cinderella lives with her stepmother &gt; and stepsisters who are very mean to her”) YES, WE WOULD ALLOW THIS STATEMENT TO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR &gt; BOTH MC2 AND MC3. How do you handle situations in which an utterance clearly &gt; relates to an MC, but is formulated with different words? Do &gt; you handle it differently if the utterance requires an &gt; inference to understand how it is related? (e.g., “her dad &gt; introduces Cinderella to his new wife” – implies he got &gt; re-married \\[MC1\\]; “the king is upset that his son hasn’t &gt; married” – implies the king thinks his son should get married &gt; \\[MC6\\]; “one of the caveats of the fairy’s spell is that it &gt; ended at midnight” – implies \\[MC18\\]) THESE EXAMPLES SHOULD NOT COUNT TOWARDS THE MCs YOU &gt; IDENTIFIED, AS IT REQUIRES TOO MUCH INFERENCE AND DOES NOT &gt; DIRECTLY EXPRESS THE GIST; ALSO, IN OUR NORMING SAMPLE, &gt; EACH OF THOSE STATEMENTS WERE RELEVANT CONCEPTS THAT DID &gt; NOT REACH THE CUT-OFF TO BE CONSIDERED MCs. BUT SEE RULE FOR COMPLETENESS/Statements containing some &gt; of the essential information TO BE ANSWERED Concept 3: Stepmother and/or stepsisters were mean to Cinderella “They didn’t really give her enough attention” What is the strength of \"giving enough attention\" and how does &gt; it relate to main concept of \"being mean\" ? Concept 4: Cinderella was a servant to the stepmother and &gt; stepsisters. “She was white trash” Is white trash similar enough to being lesser than, but not &gt; similar enough to servitude? OR is it just a statement that is &gt; being made by the participant and it doesn't really &gt; add/contribute to the main concept?
