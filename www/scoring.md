### Scoring Main Concept Analysis

Each main concept consists of several essential elements, corresponding to the subject, main verb, object (if appropriate), and any subordinate clauses (Nicholas & Brookshire, 1995). The main concept is assigned one of 5 codes depending on accuracy and completeness.

 Code                         | Description                                                                                                                                                           | **Richardson and Dalton, 2016**   | **Kong, 2009**                         
------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:--------:|:-----------:
 Accurate & Complete (AC)     | contains all elements of the main concept on the checklist with no incorrect information                                                                              | 3 Points | 3 Points  
 Accurate & Incomplete (AI)   | contains no incorrect information, but leaves out at least one essential element of the main concept on the checklist                                                 | 2 Points | 2 Point 
 Inaccurate & Complete (IC)   | contains at least one incorrect piece of essential information (e.g., "knight" for "prince") but includes all essential elements of the main concept on the checklist | 2 Points | 1 Point  
 Inaccurate & Incomplete (II) | clearly corresponds with a main concept on the checklist but includes at least one incorrect essential element and fails to include at least one essential element    | 1 Point  | 1 Point                              
 Absent (AB)                  | did not produce the main concept                                                                                                                                      | 0 Points | 0 Points

To our knowledge, norms for AphasiaBank stimuli are only available for the Richardson & Dalton 2016 scoring system. If using the Kong, 2009 system, scores cannot be compared to the Richardson & Dalton 2016 norms.

Nicholas and Brookshire also developed a series of coding rules to assist in determining the accuracy and completeness of main concepts. These coding rules are now supplemented with the published checklists, which provide common alternatives produced for each main concept, since there is variability in the syntax and vocabulary that could be used to produce a main concept. These alternative lists are not comprehensive, so it is possible that a client may produce an acceptable alternative that is not in the checklist.
