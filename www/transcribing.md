Orthographically transcribe a sample. Separate utterances or C-units with a period and space, just as you normally would with sentences. Utterances or C-units (conversational unit) are strings of words that:

1. Are followed by a pause of 1 second or more;
2. End with a terminal intonation contour; or
3. Have a complete grammatical structure.

Having a complete grammatical structure is a sure mark of an utterance, but often an utterance
may have an incomplete structure in short one-word answers. Also, although a following pause
can mark an utterance, often another person will talk right away, cancelling the pause (AphasiaBank, SLP's Guide: https://talkbank.org/manuals/Clin-CLAN.pdf)
