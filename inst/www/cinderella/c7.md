7.King announces <sup>1</sup>***there is going to be*** <sup>2</sup>***a ball*** in honor of son who needs to find a wife.

1. Will be, is to be, is
2. Dance, big party, celebration, gala

- Note: Occasionally this concept was combined with number 8 in a statement like, “They got an invitation to the ball the king was hosting for his son.” This should receive full credit for concepts 7 and 8.
