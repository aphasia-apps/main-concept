Separate utterances by periods. Follow utterance segmentation rules below, adapted from CHAT Transcription Training/AphasiaBank

In general, an utterance can be defined as a segment of running speech that appears to form a coherent unit (Saffran et al., 1989). When in doubt, err on the side of creating shorter rather than longer utterances. The following indicators are recommended, with primary weight given to syntax and intonation:

  - Syntax – Unless there are strong prosodic counter-indications, a well-formed sentence is considered to be an utterance. However, an utterance may not necessarily be grammatically correct to be considered an utterance.
  - Intonation – Falling intonation (or rising intonation in the case of a question) suggests the end of an utterance. 
  - Pauses – Pauses may not be a reliable guide to utterance boundaries. When pauses occur in what appear to be otherwise well-formed utterances, disregard them. 
  - Semantics – Semantic criteria cannot be stringently applied in marking utterance boundaries in this population.
