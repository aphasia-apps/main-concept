9.<sup>1</sup>***Put*** <sup>2</sup>***the two pieces*** <sup>3</sup>***together***.
1. Place, smash, slap, smack, stick
2. The bread, the two slices of bread, the two sides, the peanut butter and jelly, the two, the two halves, them
3. If the speaker does not say “together” they must give some indication that the two pieces become one (i.e., “Put one piece on top of the other”, “Combine the pieces of bread”, “Put the second piece of bread on top.”)
 - The verbs “fold” and “close” cannot be used for this concept, unless the speaker tells the entire story with one piece of bread as if making half of a sandwich, see 2.2.i.
