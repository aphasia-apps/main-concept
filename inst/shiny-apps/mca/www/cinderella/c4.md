4.<sup>1</sup>***Cinderella*** <sup>2</sup>***was*** <sup>3</sup>***a servant*** to the stepmother and stepsisters.

1. She
2. Was forced to be, had to be
3. Maid, slave, domestic 

- Note: If they say the sentence in another way that expresses servitude, for example “had to wait on”, they must include stepmother and/or stepsisters, because the verb requires an object. This would be the only time they are essential for this concept.
