15.<sup>1</sup>***The fairy godmother*** <sup>2</sup>***makes*** <sup>3</sup>{***item***(***s***)} ***turn into*** {***items***}.

1. See 14.1
2. Turns, creates, changes, any other verb indicating transformation/creation
  - Must be a verb that indicates some kind of transformation or creation
3. Pumpkin and mice OR carriage/coach and horses
  - When producing this concept, only one pair needs to be mentioned, however, it must be correctly paired to receive full credit
    a. Pumpkin &#8594 carriage/coach (and horses)
    b. Mice &#8594 horses (and carriage)
    c. If they initially mention both pumpkin and mice, they do not necessarily have to mention both after the transformation occurs in order to receive full credit, and only one needs to be accurate
    d. Do not take points off for mentioning other transformations, such as dog &#8594 coachman as these are not incorrect, they simply did not reach significance.
