2.<sup>1</sup>***Get*** <sup>2</sup>***two slices*** <sup>3</sup>***of bread***.

1. See 1.1
2. A couple of slices, two pieces
  - Most speakers indicated more than one piece of bread. However, if the speaker uses one piece of bread throughout the story, and for #8 uses “fold” or “close”, or indicates in some way that they made a half sandwich, then one slice/piece of bread is allowed. Speakers must be consistent throughout the telling for this to be counted as correct.
3. If the speaker received full credit for the first concept, they do not necessarily have to repeat “of bread” to be counted correct/complete for this concept. For example, a speaker could say “You take the bread out of the pantry and get two slices.”
