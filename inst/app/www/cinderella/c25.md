25.<sup>1</sup>***Everything*** <sup>2</sup>***turns back*** <sup>3</sup>***to its original form***.

1. Pumpkin, mice, and/or clothes/dress
2. Goes back, returns, disappears
  - If the speaker uses “disappears” they do not have to specify what disappears, for example, “Everything disappears.”
3. To normal (can specify what it turns back into)

- Note: The addition of “again” at the end of the sentence paired with a verb that does not indicate change is acceptable because it implies a return to the original state (e.g.,“she got home and the dress was old again.”
