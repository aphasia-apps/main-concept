3.<sup>1</sup>***The boy*** <sup>2</sup>***(does something to refuse)*** <sup>3</sup>***the umbrella***.

1. He (if appropriate referent), the boy, (male name), I (if reported speech)
2. Doesn’t want, refuses, won’t/is not going to take, declines, says no, says he’ll be ok without
3. It (if appropriate referent)

- Note: Occasionally this concept was stated as “He won’t do it.” in reference to the mother trying to make him take the umbrella, so the action he “won’t do” is “take the umbrella” and this should receive an AC as long as the referent is produced.
