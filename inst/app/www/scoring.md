### Scoring Main Concept Analysis

Each main concept consists of several essential elements, corresponding to the subject, main verb, object (if appropriate), and any subordinate clauses (Nicholas & Brookshire, 1995). The main concept is assigned one of 5 codes depending on accuracy and completeness. Nicholas and Brookshire developed a series of coding rules to assist in determining the accuracy and completeness of main concepts. These rules are now supplemented with published checklists, which provide common alternatives and are used in this web-app.
