- The figure shows two density plots that represent the distribution of the discourse variables. (A density plot is essentially a smoothed version of a histogram.) 

- The orange plot is the density plot for persons with aphasia. The purple plot is the density plot for controls. (These plots closely correspond to the values in our publications [Richardson & Dalton, 2015, 2019; Dalton & Richardson, 2018; Dalton et al., 2020], but are updated several times a year with additional participants scored in Dr. Richardsonâ€™s lab.) 

- The vertical red dashed line represents the discourse variable score for your patient/participant. You can select different discourse variables (Composite, AC, Attempts, AC/min) by selecting the variable of interest below the plots.
