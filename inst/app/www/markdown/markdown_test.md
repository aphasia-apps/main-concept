^1^ *The boy* ^2^ *was* 3 *outside*

1.  He since referent is unambiguous; some give the boy a name

2.  Is, decided to go

3.  In his front yard, on the lawn, out of the house, etc.

Note: Sometimes, this concept was combined with number 2 in a statement like The boy was playing soccer outside or The boy was kicking the ball in the yard. These statements would receive full credit for both concept 1 and 2.
