## Welcome to the Main Concept Analysis Web-app

Main Concept Analysis (MCA) is a discourse assessment originally developed by Nicholas and Brookshire (1995) that measures the informativeness of a discourse sample on a given topic. This web-app is intended to facilitate efficient and accurate scoring of main concepts for both research and clinical practice. The app is written in the {shiny} framework, is currently in Beta, and is not yet ready for research or clinical deployment. Please note, the app does not save any data from each user session, and will time out after 5 minutes of idle use.

There is a training mode available for those unfamiliar with MCA, but it is highly recommended that anyone who would like to use MCA start by reading the manual.

### About Main Concept Analysis

Main concept checklists for several widely used tasks (including picture description, picture sequence, story retell, and procedural stimuli) have been developed based on discourse samples of control speakers (Richardson & Dalton, 2016; 2020). MCA is a hybrid discourse measure that provides some information on micro-linguistic features of the discourse sample as well as more macro-linguistic features about the overall adequacy of the discourse sample to communicate an intended message.

MCA has shown good sensitivity in differentiating between controls and individuals with communication disorders (e.g., Kong, Whiteside, & Bargmann, 2016; Dalton & Richardson, 2019) and between individuals with fluent and non-fluent aphasia (Kong et al., 2016). Importantly, studies have shown that changes in informativeness are associated with treatment performance (Albright & Purves, 2008; Avent & Austermann, 2003; Coelho, McHugh, & Boyle, 2000; Cupit, Rochon, Leonard, & Laird, 2010; Stark, 2010) and are associated with listener's perceptions of communication quality (Cupit et al., 2010; Ross & Wertz, 1999).
