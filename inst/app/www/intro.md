<h3 id="maintitle">Welcome to the Main Concept Analysis Web-app</h3>
</center>

Main Concept Analysis (MCA) is a discourse assessment originally developed by Nicholas and Brookshire (1995) that measures the informativeness of a discourse sample on a given topic. This web-app is intended to facilitate fast and reliable scoring of main concepts for both research and clinical practice. For anyone unfamiliar with MCA, we recommended starting by reading the manual and reviewing additional resources located on <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bxazjgQWx-WD8ELTJjwBm_5IToRpgQhQ/" target="_blank">google drive</a> and at <a href="https://aphasia.talkbank.org/discourse/MainConcepts" target="_blank">talkbank.org</a>. This web-app also includes several training modules for new users of MCA. 

Main Concept Analysis is intended to be used with monologic, structured discourse stimuli
from the Aphasia Bank protocol. These stimuli, and the administration protocol can be
found here: https://aphasia.talkbank.org/protocol/english/. Clinicians wishing to use
Main Concept Analysis do not need to administer the full Aphasia Bank protocol, but
may choose one or more stimuli of interest. For example, the Cinderella story task
is likely to elicit a richer language sample, but will consequently require slightly
more time to score. Conversely, the "Cat in the Tree" stimulus will elicit less language
but will be faster to score. There are also important differences in discourse "genre" 
(e.g., picture description, narrative) that clinicians may want to consider.
