#### Welcome to the Main Concept Analysis Web-app
</center>

Main Concept Analysis (MCA) is a discourse assessment originally developed by Nicholas and Brookshire (1995) that measures the informativeness of a discourse sample on a given topic. This web-app is intended to facilitate fast and reliable scoring of main concepts for both research and clinical practice. For anyone unfamiliar with MCA, we recommended starting by reading the manual and reviewing additional resources located on <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bxazjgQWx-WD8ELTJjwBm_5IToRpgQhQ/" target="_blank">google drive</a> and at <a href="https://aphasia.talkbank.org/discourse/MainConcepts" target="_blank">talkbank.org</a>. This web-app also includes several training modules for new users of MCA. 

MCA is a hybrid discourse measure that provides some information on micro-linguistic features of the discourse sample as well as more macro-linguistic features about the overall adequacy of the discourse sample to communicate an intended message. Main concept checklists have been developed for several widely used tasks (including picture description, picture sequence, story retell, and procedural stimuli) based on discourse samples of control speakers (Richardson & Dalton, 2016; 2020). 

MCA has shown good sensitivity in differentiating between controls and individuals with communication disorders (e.g., Kong, Whiteside, & Bargmann, 2016; Dalton & Richardson, 2019) and between individuals with fluent and non-fluent aphasia (Kong et al., 2016). Studies have shown that changes in informativeness are associated with treatment performance (Albright & Purves, 2008; Avent & Austermann, 2003; Coelho, McHugh, & Boyle, 2000; Cupit, Rochon, Leonard, & Laird, 2010; Stark, 2010) and are associated with listener's perceptions of communication quality (Cupit et al., 2010; Ross & Wertz, 1999).
