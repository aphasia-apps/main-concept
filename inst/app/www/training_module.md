There are 3 training modules for scoring main concept analysis. The training modules will provide orthographic transcriptions and will ask you to transcribe and segment the transcripts, and then score them as if you were using the app. Feedback will be provided throughout each training module. If you are new to main concept analysis, we recommend that you start by reading through the full scoring manual linked on the front page.
