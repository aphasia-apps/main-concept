<h3 id="maintitle">About Main Concept Analysis</h3>

MCA is a hybrid discourse measure that provides some information on micro-linguistic features of the discourse sample as well as more macro-linguistic features about the overall adequacy of the discourse sample to communicate an intended message. Main concept checklists have been developed for several widely used tasks (including picture description, picture sequence, story retell, and procedural stimuli) based on discourse samples of control speakers (Richardson & Dalton, 2016; 2020). 

MCA has shown good sensitivity in differentiating between controls and individuals with communication disorders (e.g., Kong, Whiteside, & Bargmann, 2016; Dalton & Richardson, 2019) and between individuals with fluent and non-fluent aphasia (Kong et al., 2016). Studies have shown that changes in informativeness are associated with treatment performance (Albright & Purves, 2008; Avent & Austermann, 2003; Coelho, McHugh, & Boyle, 2000; Cupit, Rochon, Leonard, & Laird, 2010; Stark, 2010) and are associated with listener's perceptions of communication quality (Cupit et al., 2010; Ross & Wertz, 1999).
