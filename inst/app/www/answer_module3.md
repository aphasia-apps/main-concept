**After transcribing for main concept:**  "Okay. Looks like the problem is the cat is stuck up in a tree. Okay. Father is out on the. and he's kind of stuck himself I think. The little girl is crying for the cat. She's got an umbrella. There's a guy up in the or a dog barking up the tree. And the fire department is coming. A little girl was trying to reach him I guess. I don't know if she was trying to get this ladder or not. I have no idea about that. But anyway the firemen are coming. The fire truck is there. And they're coming out with a ladder apparently to help get the cat and father out of the tree."
