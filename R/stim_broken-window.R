"1.<sup>1</sup>***The boy***  <sup>2</sup>***was***  <sup>3</sup>***outside***.
1.  He since referent is unambiguous; some give the boy a name
2.  Is, decided to go
3.  In his front yard, on the lawn, out of the house, etc.

- Note: Sometimes, this concept was combined with number 2 in a statement like “The boy was playing soccer outside” or “The boy was kicking the ball in the yard.” These statements would receive full credit for both concept 1 and 2.

bw2 <- 
"2.<sup>1</sup>***A/The boy*** <sup>2</sup>***was playing*** <sup>3</sup>***soccer***.
1. See 1.1
2. Played, is kicking, kicks, is practicing, etc.
3. With the soccer ball, with the ball, with the football (if not from U.S.)

- Note: “He has a ball” or “He has a soccer ball” did not count towards this concept because it does not imply any kind of action with the soccer ball, and boy-action-ball was the concept that met criterion.
